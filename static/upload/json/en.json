All the people wept and beat their breasts for the daughter. Jesus said, \"Don't cry! She is not dead, but asleep.\" When they knew that their daughter was dead, they laughed at Jesus. Jesus took her hand and called out, \"Daughter, get up!\" and her soul came back. , and she got up immediately and Jesus told her to give her something to eat.

As detailed before: Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead and reborn ( <span style=\"color:#006600;\">Newcomer<\/span> ) is to abide in Christ, to be hidden with Christ in God, to be with Christ in heavenly places, and to be seated at the right hand of God the Father, and in your hearts → as Paul said in Romans 7:22! Because according to my inner meaning (the original text is man) → the invisible person who lives in your hearts is the regenerated new man. This new man was resurrected with Christ and is a spiritual body. Of course, you cannot see it with your naked eyes. The spiritual body is connected with life. First with the tree of life in heaven, with Jesus Christ life, eat the spiritual food of life, drink the living water of the spring of life, be renewed day by day in Christ and grow into a man, full of the stature of the fullness of Christ. On that day, Jesus Christ will come. When he comes again, the reborn The new man will be revealed and revealed → a more beautiful resurrection! Amen. Just like a bee produces a \"queen bee\" in its hive, this \"queen bee\" is larger and plumper than other bees. Our new man is the same in Christ.

Some churches do not have the presence of the Holy Spirit and do not preach the true doctrine of the gospel. This causes many brothers and sisters to sit there and listen every week, and they cannot understand what they are hearing. !If you have not eaten and drank the spiritual food of life, have not been regenerated, and have not put on (the new man) Christ, you become pitiful and naked. Therefore, the Lord Jesus rebuked those churches like Laodicea → You said: I am rich, have gained wealth, and need nothing; but I do not know that you are wretched, wretched, poor, blind, and naked. I urge you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so that you may be rich; and white garments, so that you may not be exposed; and eye drops, to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.

Why is this? There are also people who become stubborn and resist the true way, destroy the true way, and persecute the children of God. In the end, they will betray Jesus and the children of God.<br \/>\nTherefore, if there is anyone who does not understand, he should humbly pray to God and seek, and he will find; and the door will be opened to him who knocks.

Dedication of two kinds of people<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1)Cain and Abel\n<\/p>\nCain → One day Cain brought an offering from the fruits of the ground to the LORD;<br \/>\nAbel → Abel also offered the firstborn of his flock and their fat. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but not for Cain and his offering.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tCain became very angry and his countenance changed. Genesis 4:3-5\n<\/p>\n<strong>ask<\/strong> :Why did you take a fancy to Abel and his offering?<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>answer<\/strong> : By faith Abel (offering the best firstlings of his flock and their fat) offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, and thus received testimony that he was justified, that God pointed out that he was righteous. The gift bears witness. Even though he died, he still spoke because of this faith. Reference Hebrews 11:4 ;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Cain offered was without faith, love, and reverence for God, Jehovah. He just offered what the ground produced casually, and he did not offer the first fruits of the good produce as an offering. Although the Bible did not explain it, God had already rebuked him. He said that his offering was not good and was not acceptable.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→The Lord said to Cain: \"Why are you angry? Why is your countenance changed? If you do well, will you not be accepted? If you do poorly, sin lurks at the door. It will lust after you. You, you shall subdue it.” Genesis 4:6-7.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Hypocrites give tithes\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Jesus) said, “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you tithe mint, fennel, and celery;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOn the contrary, the more important matters in the law, namely justice, mercy, and faithfulness, are no longer acceptable. This is the more important thing you should do; it is also necessary. Matthew 23:23\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Pharisee stood and prayed to himself: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, nor like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of everything I get. ’ Luke 18:11-12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) God does not like those offered according to the law\n<\/p>\nYou do not like burnt offerings and sin offerings.<br \/>\nAt that time I said: God, here I come,<br \/>\nTo do your will;<br \/>\nMy deeds are written in the scrolls.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tIt says: “Sacrifice and gift, burnt offering and sin offering, which you did not want and which you did not like (these are according to the law)”; Hebrews 10:6-8\n<\/p>\n<strong>ask<\/strong> : Why don’t you like what is offered according to the law?<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>answer<\/strong> : What is offered according to the law is a command that requires the implementation of regulations, rather than a willing offering. Such a offering reminds people of sins every year, but it cannot get rid of sins.\n<\/p>\nBut these sacrifices were an annual reminder of sin; for the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sin. Hebrews 10:3-4<br \/>\n<p>\n\t(4) Donate \"one-tenth\"\n<\/p>\n“Everything on earth,<br \/>\nWhether it is the seed on the ground or the fruit on the tree,<br \/>\nThe tenth is the Lord’s;<br \/>\nIt is holy to the LORD.<br \/>\n<p>\n\t---Leviticus 27:30\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→Abraham gave tithe\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHe blessed Abram and said, \"May the Lord of heaven and earth, the Most High God, bless Abram!

Luke 18:12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Note:<\/strong> Because Abraham and Jacob knew in their hearts that everything they received was given by God, so they were willing to give ten percent;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Pharisees, on the other hand, were under the law and donated according to the regulations of the law. They obtained all their money by their own cleverness. They reluctantly donated one tenth of \"everything I earned\", just like paying taxes compulsorily.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the behavior and mentality of giving “tenth” is completely different.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. Dedication of the poor widow<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus looked up and saw the rich man putting his donation into the treasury, and a poor widow putting in two small coins. He said, \"Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others, for everyone has more than they have.\" , and put it into the offering, but the widow put in all she had to live on out of her own insufficiency (faith in loving God).” Luke 21:1-4\n<\/p>\n<span style=\"color:#003399;\">poverty<\/span> :Poverty of material money<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#003399;\">widowed<\/span> :Loneliness without support<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#003399;\">woman<\/span> : It means that the woman is weak.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. Donate money to the saints<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nConcerning giving for the saints, just as I commanded the churches in Galatia, so you must also do. On the first day of every week, each person is to set aside money according to his own income, so that he will not have to collect it when I come. 1 Corinthians 16:1-2<br \/>\nBut do not forget to do good and to donate, for such sacrifices please God. Hebrews 13:16<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5.

Even when they were in great trials and tribulations, they were still full of joy. Even in the midst of extreme poverty, they showed great kindness in giving.

For the Macedonians and Achaeans were willing to collect donations for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.<br \/>\nAlthough this is their willingness, it is actually considered a debt owed (a debt owed to preaching the gospel and providing for the shortcomings of the saints and the poor); because since the Gentiles share in their spiritual benefits, they should use the things that support their health. Supply them.

Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, they will lead you to eat and drink the spiritual food of life, so that your spiritual life will be richer and you will have a better resurrection in the future. Amen!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou followed Jesus, believed in the true gospel, and supported the servants who preached the true gospel!

Amen!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Just like the tribe of Levi paid tithe through Abraham)\n<\/p>\n→→It can also be said that Levi, who received the tithe, also received the tithe through Abraham. Because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was already in the body (original text, loins) of his ancestor.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tHebrews 7:9-10\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t【Christians should be alert:】\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf some people follow→and believe→those preachers who preach false doctrines and confuse the true gospel, and they do not understand the Bible, the salvation of Christ, and rebirth, then you are not reborn, do you believe it or not.

At that time, there were no servants of God preaching the gospel or speaking the truth, and the door to salvation was closed.

If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. Romans 8:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 The conflict between the Holy Spirit and the lust of the flesh\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusteth against the flesh: these two are opposed to each other, so that you cannot do what you wish to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The works of the flesh are obvious: adultery, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, dissensions, heresies, and envy. , drunkenness, revelry, etc. I told you before and I tell you now that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Galatians 5:16-21\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4 Put to death the evil deeds of the body by the Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBrothers, it seems that we are not debtors to the flesh to live according to the flesh. If you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. Romans 8:12-13 and Colossians 3:5-8\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t5 Put on the new self and put off the old self\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDo not lie to one another, for you have put off your old self and its deeds and have put on the new self. The new man is renewed in knowledge into the image of his Creator. Colossians 3:9-10 and Ephesians 4:22-24\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t6 The old man’s flesh is gradually deteriorating, but the new man is being renewed day by day in Christ.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we do not lose heart. Although the outer body (the old man) is being destroyed, the inner man (the new man) is being renewed day by day. Our light and momentary sufferings will work for us an eternal weight of glory beyond compare. 2 Corinthians 4:16-17\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t7 Grow up to Christ, the Head\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo equip the saints for the work of ministry, and to build up the body of Christ, until we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,… only by Love speaks the truth and grows in all things into Him who is the Head, Christ, by whom the whole body is held together and fitted together, with every joint serving its purpose and supporting one another according to the function of each part, causing the body to grow and build itself up in love. Ephesians 4:12-13,15-16\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t8 A more beautiful resurrection\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA woman had her own dead raised to life. Others endured severe torture and refused to be released (the original text was redemption) in order to obtain a better resurrection. Hebrews 11:35\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Pray and ask at any time\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Pray often and don’t lose heart\n<\/p>\nJesus told a parable to teach people to pray often and not lose heart. Luke 18:1<br \/>\n<p>\n\tWhatever you ask for in prayer, just believe, and you will receive it. ” Matthew 21:22\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Tell God what you want through prayer and supplication\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:6-7\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Pray in the Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut, dear brothers, build yourselves up in the most holy faith, pray in the Holy Spirit,\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tKeep yourselves in the love of God, looking to the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto everlasting life. Jude 1:20-21\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(4) Pray with spirit as well as with understanding\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul said, \"What about this?\" I want to pray with the spirit and also with the understanding; I want to sing with the spirit and also with the understanding. 1 Corinthians 14:15\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(5) The Holy Spirit prays for us with groans\n<\/p>\n#The Holy Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God’s will#<br \/>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness; we do not know how to pray, but the Holy Spirit Himself prays for us with unutterable groanings. He who searches the hearts knows the thoughts of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. Romans 8:26-27\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(6) Be cautious, watchful and pray\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe end of all things is near. Therefore, be careful and sober, watch and pray. 1 Peter 4:7\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(7) The prayers of righteous people are very effective in healing.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf any of you is suffering, he should pray; if anyone is happy, he should sing praises. If any of you is sick, he should call the elders of the church; they may anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord and pray for him. The prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has sinned (sins of the old man's flesh), he will be forgiven. (Refer to Hebrews 10:17) Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great effect. James 5:13-16\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(8) Pray and lay hands on the sick to be healed\n<\/p>\nAt that time, Publius's father lay sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went in, prayed for him, laid his hands on him, and healed him. Acts 28:8<br \/>\nJesus could not perform any miracles there, but he only laid hands on a few sick people and healed them. Mark 6:5<br \/>\n<p>\n\tDo not be hasty when laying hands on others; do not participate in other people's sins, but keep yourself clean. 1 Timothy 5:22\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#FF9900;\">3. Be a good soldier of Christ<\/span> \n<\/p>\nSuffer with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 2 Timothy 2:3<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnd I looked, and behold the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. …These have not been tainted with women; they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men as firstfruits for God and for the Lamb. Revelation 14:1,4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4. Working together with Christ\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor we are laborers together with God; you are God’s field and His building. 1 Corinthians 3:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t5. There are 100, 60, and 30 times\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd some fell into good soil and bore fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold. Matthew 13:8\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t6. Receive glory, reward, and crown\n<\/p>\nIf they are children, then they are heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. If we suffer with Him, we will also be glorified with Him. Romans 8:17<br \/>\nI press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Philippians 3:14<br \/>\n<p>\n\t(The Lord said) I am coming quickly, and you must hold on to what you have, so that no one takes your crown away. Revelation 3:11\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t7. Reigning with Christ\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBlessed and holy are those who take part in the first resurrection! The second death has no authority over them. They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Christ a thousand years. Revelation 20:6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t8.

Put on the helmet of salvation\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Salvation\n<\/p>\nThe Lord has invented his salvation, and has shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations; Psalm 98:2<br \/>\nSing to the LORD and bless his name! Preach His salvation every day! Psalm 96:2<br \/>\n<p>\n\tHe who brings good news, peace, good news, and salvation says to Zion: Your God reigns! How beautiful are the feet of this man climbing the mountain! Isaiah 52:7\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How do people know God’s salvation?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Forgiveness of sins - then you know salvation!\n<\/p>\nNote: If your religious \"conscience\" always feels guilty, the sinner's conscience will not be cleansed and forgiven! You would not know God's salvation - See Hebrews 10:2.<br \/>\nWe should believe what God says in the Bible according to His words. This is right and correct. Amen! As the Lord Jesus said: My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me - Reference John 10:27<br \/>\nThat his people may know salvation through the forgiveness of their sins…<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAll flesh will see God’s salvation!

Repent and believe the gospel!\" Mark 1:15\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Paul said) I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For the righteousness of God is revealed in this gospel; this righteousness is by faith from faith to faith. As it is written: “The righteous shall live by faith.” Romans 1:16-17\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo you believe in Jesus and the gospel! This gospel is the salvation of Jesus Christ. If you believe in this gospel, your sins can be forgiven, saved, reborn, and have eternal life! Amen.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How do you believe this gospel?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n[1] Believe that Jesus was a virgin conceived and born of the Holy Spirit - Matthew 1:18,21<br \/>\n[2] Belief that Jesus is the Son of God-Luke 1:30-35<br \/>\n[3] Believe that Jesus came in the flesh - 1 John 4:2, John 1:14<br \/>\n[4] Belief in Jesus is the original way of life and the light of life - John 1:1-4, 8:12, 1 John 1:1-2<br \/>\n[5] Believe in the Lord God who laid the sin of us all on Jesus - Isaiah 53:6<br \/>\n<p>\n\t[6] Believe in the love of Jesus! He died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Note: Christ died for our sins!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 that we all may be freed from sin - Romans 6:7;\n<\/p>\n2 Freed from the law and its curse - Romans 7:6, Galatians 3:13;<br \/>\n3 Delivered from the power of Satan - Acts 26:18<br \/>\n4 Delivered from the World - John 17:14<br \/>\nAnd buried!<br \/>\n5 Set us free from the old self and its practices - Colossians 3:9;<br \/>\n6 Out of self-Galatians 2:20<br \/>\nResurrected on the third day!<br \/>\n<p>\n\t7 Christ’s resurrection has regenerated us and justified us! Amen. 1 Peter 1:3 and Romans 4:25\n<\/p>\n[7] Adoption as sons of God-Galatians 4:5<br \/>\n[8] Put on the new self, put on Christ - Galatians 3:26-27<br \/>\n[9] The Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God - Romans 8:16<br \/>\n[10] Translate us (the new man) into the kingdom of God’s beloved Son - Colossians 2:13<br \/>\n[11] Our regenerated new life is hidden with Christ in God - Colossians 3:3<br \/>\n[12] When Christ appears, we also will appear with him in glory - Colossians 3:4<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThis is the salvation of Jesus Christ.

Amen.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Hold the sword of the Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Receive the promised Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to receive the promised Holy Spirit?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Hear the gospel, the true way, and believe in Jesus!\n<\/p>\nIn Him you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, when you also believed in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Ephesians 1:13<br \/>\nFor example, Simon Peter preached in the house of \"Gentiles\" Cornelius. These Gentiles heard the word of truth, the gospel of their salvation, and believed in Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit fell on all those who listened. Reference Acts 10:34-48<br \/>\n<p>\n\t(2) The Holy Spirit testifies with our hearts that we are children of God\n<\/p>\nFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. You did not receive the spirit of bondage to remain in fear; you received the spirit of adoption, in which we cry, “Abba, Father!” The Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God; and if we are children, That is, heirs, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ. If we suffer with Him, we will also be glorified with Him.<br \/>\nRomans 8:14-17<br \/>\n<p>\n\t(3) The treasure is placed in an earthen vessel\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe have this treasure in earthen vessels to show that this great power comes from God and not from us. 2 Corinthians 4:7\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is this treasure?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: It is the Holy Spirit of truth! Amen\n<\/p>\n\"If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter (or Comforter; the same below), that he may be with you forever, who is the truth. The world cannot accept the Holy Spirit; for it neither sees Him nor knows Him, but you know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you John 14:15-17.<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3. It is the Word of God\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the Word of God?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The gospel preached to you is the word of God!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) In the beginning there was Tao\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the beginning there was the Tao, and the Tao was with God, and the Tao was God. This Word was with God in the beginning. John 1:1-2\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) The Word became flesh\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth. And we have beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father. John 1:14\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Believe in the gospel and be reborn. This gospel is the word of God.\n<\/p>\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy he has begotten us again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead... You have been born again, not of perishable seed but of incorruptible seed, Through the living and abiding word of God. …Only the Word of the Lord endures forever.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThis is the gospel that was preached to you. 1 Peter 1:3,23,25\n<\/p>\nBrothers and sisters!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tRemember to collect.\n<\/p>\nGospel transcript from:<br \/>\n<p>\n\tthe church in lord jesus christ\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2023.09.17\n<\/p>","cover":"","description":"","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","views":"9","likes":"0","status":"0","can_comment":"0","create_at":"1735791975","update_at":"1735791975","lang":"en"},{"id":"31442","category_id":"35","tag_ids":"[\"527\"]","title":"Put on Spiritual Armor 5","slug":"put-on-spiritual-armor-5","author":"admin","content":"<p>\n\tPeace to all brothers and sisters!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tToday we continue to examine fellowship and share: Christians must put on the spiritual armor given by God every day.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLecture 5: Use faith as a shield\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet’s open our Bible to Ephesians 6:16 and read it together: Furthermore, taking the shield of faith, which is able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Note: The paper version is \"vine\"; the electronic version is \"shield\")\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20231105151720342.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1.

Confidence\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) letter\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is a letter?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\nFaith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. The ancients had wonderful evidence in this letter.<br \/>\nBy faith we know that the worlds were created by the word of God; so that what is seen was not created out of the obvious. (Hebrews 11:1-3)<br \/>\n<p>\n\tFor example, a farmer is planting wheat in the field. He expects that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and is planted, it will produce many grains in the future. This is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Based on faith and to faith\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor the righteousness of God is revealed in this gospel; this righteousness is by faith from faith to faith. As it is written: “The righteous shall live by faith.” (Romans 1:17)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Faith and promise\n<\/p>\nBelieve in Jesus and receive eternal life:<br \/>\n“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.

Amen!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tIf they are children, then they are heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. If we suffer with Him, we will also be glorified with Him. (Romans 8:17)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. Taking faith as a shield\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, taking up the shield of faith, with which you can quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one; (Ephesians 6:16)\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to use faith as a shield?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1)Faith\n<\/p>\n1 Believe that Jesus was conceived by the virgin and born of the Holy Spirit - Matthew 1:18,21<br \/>\n2 Believe that Jesus is the Word made flesh - John 1:14<br \/>\n3 Belief that Jesus is the Son of God-Luke 1:31-35<br \/>\n4 Believe in Jesus as the Savior, Christ, and Messiah - Luke 2:11, John 1:41<br \/>\n5 Faith in the Lord lays the sin of us all upon Jesus - Isaiah 53:8<br \/>\n6 Believe that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day - 1 Corinthians 15:3-4<br \/>\n7 Belief that Jesus rose from the dead and regenerated us - 1 Peter 1:3<br \/>\n8 Belief in the resurrection of Jesus justifies us - Romans 4:25<br \/>\n9 Because the Holy Spirit lives in us, our new self is no longer of the old self and flesh - Romans 8:9<br \/>\n10 The Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God - Romans 8:16<br \/>\n11 Put on the new self, put on Christ - Gal 3:26-27<br \/>\n12 Believe that the Holy Spirit gives us various gifts, authority and power (such as preaching the gospel, healing the sick, casting out demons, performing miracles, speaking in tongues, etc.) - 1 Corinthians 12:7-11<br \/>\n13 We who suffered for the faith of the Lord Jesus will be glorified with Him - Romans 8:17<br \/>\n14 Resurrection with a better body-Hebrews 11:35<br \/>\n<p>\n\t15 Reign with Christ for a thousand years and forever! Amen-Revelation 20:6,22:5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Faith serves as a shield to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one\n<\/p>\n1 Discern the deception of the evil one - Ephesians 4:14<br \/>\n2 can resist the devil’s schemes - Ephesians 6:11<br \/>\n3 Reject all temptation-Matthew 18:6-9<br \/>\n(For example: the customs of this world, idols, computer games, mobile networks, artificial intelligence... follow the desires of the flesh and heart - Ephesians 2:1-8)<br \/>\n4. To resist the enemy in the day of trouble - Ephesians 6:13<br \/>\n(As recorded in the Bible: Satan struck Job and gave him boils from his feet to his head - Job 2:7; Satan's messenger put a thorn in Paul's flesh - 2 Corinthians 12:7)<br \/>\n5 I say to you, \"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees (who are justified by the law) and the Sadducees (who do not believe in the resurrection of the dead).\" This does not refer to bread. Why don't you understand? ” Matthew 16:11<br \/>\n6 Resist him, firm in the faith, knowing that your brothers throughout the world are also undergoing the same kind of suffering. The God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect you, strengthen you, and give you strength. 1 Peter 5:9-10<br \/>\n<p>\n\t7 Therefore, obey God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and God will draw near to you…James 4:7-8\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3)Those who overcome through Jesus\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Better than the devil, better than the world, better than death!)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor whoever is born of God overcomes the world; and that which overcomes the world is our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Isn’t it the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 1 John 5:4-5\n<\/p>\n1 Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches! To him who overcomes, I will give him to eat from the tree of life in the Paradise of God. ’” Revelation 2:7<br \/>\n2 …He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death. ’”<br \/>\nRevelation 2:11<br \/>\n3 …To him who overcomes, I will give the hidden manna, and to him a white stone, with a new name written on it, which no one will know except the one who receives it. ’” Revelation 2:17<br \/>\n4 He who overcomes and keeps my commandments to the end, to him will I give authority over the nations; ... and to him I will give the morning star. Revelation 2:26,28<br \/>\n5 Whoever overcomes will be clothed in white, and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but he will confess his name in the presence of my Father, and in the presence of all his angels. Revelation 3:5<br \/>\n6 He who overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never go out from there again. And I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is the New Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven, from my God, and my new name. Revelation 3:12<br \/>\n<p>\n\t7 To him who overcomes, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, even as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne.

Peter said\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has given us new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you. …You have been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God. …but the word of the Lord endures forever. This is the gospel that was preached to you. (1 Peter 1:3-4,23,25)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. John said\n<\/p>\nIn the beginning there was the Tao, and the Tao was with God, and the Tao was God. This Word was with God in the beginning. (John 1:1-2)<br \/>\n<p>\n\tConcerning the original word of life from the beginning, this is what we have heard, seen, seen with our own eyes, and touched with our hands. (This life has been manifested, and we have seen it, and now testify that we pass on to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested in us.) (1 John 1:1-2)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4. Paul said\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you will be saved by this gospel, if you do not believe in vain but hold fast what I preach to you. For what I also delivered to you: first, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15 :2-4)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2.

I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields. The crops are ripe and ready for harvest. The reaper receives his wages and gathers grain for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. As the saying goes: ‘One sows, another reaps’, and this is obviously true.

He was a perfect and upright man, a man who feared God and shunned evil. (Job 1:1)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 The greatest among the Orientals:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHis property consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, five hundred she-donkeys, and many servants and maids. This man is the greatest among the people of the East. (Job 1:3)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 Job calls himself righteous\n<\/p>\nI clothe myself with righteousness,<br \/>\nWear justice as your robe and crown.<br \/>\nI am the eyes of the blind,<br \/>\nLame feet.<br \/>\nI am a father to the poor;<br \/>\nI find out the case of someone I have never met.<br \/>\n…My glory increases in me;<br \/>\nMy bow grows stronger in my hand. …I choose their paths, and I sit in the first place….<br \/>\n<p>\n\t(Job 29:14-16,20,25)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJob once said: I am righteous, but God has taken away my justice; (Job 34:5)\n<\/p>\nNote: (Job’s repentance) Job 38 to 42, Jehovah answered Job’s argument. After Job listened to Jehovah’s words\/\/<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThen the LORD said to Job: Shall a arguer argue with the Almighty? Those who argue with God can answer these! …(Job) I am vile! What shall I answer you with? I had to cover my mouth with my hands. I said it once and I didn’t answer; I said it twice and I didn’t say it again. (Job 40:1-2,4-5)\n<\/p>\nPlease listen to me, I want to speak; I ask you, please show me. I heard about you before,<br \/>\nSee you now with my own eyes. Therefore I hate myself (or translation: my words) and repent in dust and ashes. (Job 42:4-6)<br \/>\n<p>\n\tLater, the Lord favored Job, and the Lord later blessed him even more than before.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Job’s righteousness was human righteousness (self-righteousness), and he was the greatest among the people of the East. \"He said, \"I went out to the city gate and set up a seat in the street. The young people saw me and avoided me, and the old people stood up. The princes stopped talking and covered their mouths with their hands. The leaders were silent and stuck their tongues to the roof of their mouths. He who hears me with his ears calls me blessed; he who sees me with his eyes praises me;\n<\/p>\n…my glory increases in my body; my bow grows stronger in my hand. When people hear me, they look up and wait silently for my guidance.<br \/>\n<p>\n\t…I chose their ways, and I sat in the first place…(Job 29:7-11,20-21,25)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t---And what did the Lord Jesus say? ---\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t“Woe to you when everyone says good things about you!…” (Luke 6:26).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJob claimed to be righteous and “righteous”, but disaster befell him and his family. Later, Job repented before the Lord! I heard about you before, but now I see you with my own eyes. Therefore I hate myself (or translation: my words), and repent in dust and ashes!

(Ephesians 4:24)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPut on a new man. The new man is renewed in knowledge into the image of his Creator. (Colossians 3:10)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPut on Christ:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

(Ephesians 4:21-22 Union Version)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(7) The new man “spiritual man” is renewed day by day in Christ\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we do not lose heart. Although the outer body is being destroyed, yet the inner body is being renewed day by day. Our light and momentary sufferings will work for us an eternal weight of glory beyond compare. It turns out that we care not about what is seen, but about what is unseen; for what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:16-18 KJV)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThat your faith may not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of God. (1 Corinthians 2:5 KJV)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul is for the word of God and the gospel! In the flesh, he experienced tribulations and chains in the world. When he was imprisoned in Philippi, he saw the soldier jailer wearing full armor. He was inspired by the Holy Spirit! So he wrote a letter to all the saints in Ephesus. Christians have spiritual blessings. They rely on the power of God and are good soldiers of Christ. They must put on the whole armor of God.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTake heed to yourselves, and do not act as fools, but as wise. Make the most of the time, for these days are evil. Don’t be a fool, but understand what the Lord’s will is.

Girdle your loins and get ready for a day's work.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(As Paul said) I have one final word: Be strong in the Lord and in His power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you can stand against the devil's schemes. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Are those acts committing adultery?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Husband and wife\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 The marriage of God’s cooperation\n<\/p>\nA man will leave his parents and cleave to his wife, and the two will become one flesh! A marriage joined by God cannot be separated by man. For example, a husband misses his wife or a wife misses her husband. The two are naked and \"united\" without shame → this is love. Please refer to 1 Corinthians 7:3-4.<br \/>\nExample: Adam and Eve - refer to Genesis 2:18-24<br \/>\nExample: Abraham and Sarah - refer to Genesis 12:1-5<br \/>\n<p>\n\tExample: Isaac and Rebekah - refer to Genesis 24:67\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 A marriage blessed by God\n<\/p>\nExample: Noah and his family - refer to Genesis 6:18<br \/>\nExample: Jacob was loved by God, and his two wives and two maids gave birth to the twelve tribes of Israel. This was a marriage blessed by God!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tExample: Ruth and Boaz – Reference Luke: 4:13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 It is not a marriage coordinated by God\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, if Abraham takes a concubine and sleeps with Hagar, Abraham will feel \"ashamed\" in his heart because he is unworthy of his wife Sarah! Therefore, it is a marriage that is not pleasing to God. In the end, most of the descendants of Hagar who \"begot\" Ishmael deviated from God's ways and abandoned God.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4 God does not look at human behavior\n<\/p>\nExample: Tamash and Judah<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThe behavior of Tamar, the daughter-in-law, and her father-in-law was considered a sin of \"fornication\" according to the laws of the flesh. However, God did not consider Tamar's behavior. He only considered her faith in God and her faith in bearing a son for the house of Judah. God declared her righteous. She is listed in Jesus’ genealogy. Refer to Genesis 38:24-26, Matthew 1:3 and Deuteronomy 22 \"The Ordinance of Chastity\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tExample: Lahab and Salmon--Matthew 1:5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tExample: David and Bathsheba\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDavid committed \"adultery and borrowing a sword to kill.\" After David was disciplined by God, he gave birth to Solomon. God loved Solomon. And because David loved God wholeheartedly and followed God’s will in everything (leading the Israelites to trust God), he was called a man after God’s own heart. See Acts 13:22 and 2 Samuel 11-12.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Unmarried men and women\n<\/p>\n\"Boys and girls\" refers to unmarried men and women. Boys and girls fall in love with each other and want to start a family. This is the beginning of love. If you have lustful thoughts with the other person in your heart, you are committing adultery.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAs the Lord Jesus said: But I say to you, whoever looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Matthew 5:28\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Widows. Divorce and marriage issues\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery. ” Matthew 19:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[As Paul’s own opinion]\n<\/p>\n1 To the unmarried and the widows<br \/>\n<p>\n\tIf you can't help it, you can get married. Instead of burning with desire, it would be better to get married. 1 Corinthians 7:9\n<\/p>\n2 If your husband dies, you can remarry<br \/>\n<p>\n\tWhile the husband is alive, the wife is bound; if the husband dies, the wife is free to remarry as she pleases, but only to the person who is in the Lord. 1 Corinthians 7:39\n<\/p>\n(4) Extramarital affairs<br \/>\n\"Hongxing comes out of the wall\" describes a woman who is in full bloom and her sexual desires are activated during the estrus period. It refers to the wife having an affair and having an affair with a man. Whether a man has an extramarital affair or a woman has an extramarital affair, their behavior is committing adultery.<br \/>\n(5)Promiscuity<br \/>\nBoth promiscuity and fornication between men and women are acts of committing adultery.<br \/>\nTherefore, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Their women have turned their natural use into an unnatural use; and so have their men, who have forsaken their natural use, and are consumed by lust, and lust after one another, and men do shameful things with men, and deserve for it upon themselves. retribution. Reference Romans 1:26-27<br \/>\n(6)Masturbation<br \/>\n<p>\n\t\"Pleasure of sin\": Some men or women obtain physical satisfaction and pleasure from sin through masturbation and masturbation. After the addiction wears off, they feel regret, pain, and emptiness in their souls. This is the act of committing adultery.\n<\/p>\n(7)Night dreams (wet dreams)<br \/>\n<p>\n\t\"Thinking every day, dreaming every night\": A man's body secretes androgen hormones and discharges \"semen\". At night, he will follow the lust of his body. When he sleeps, he dreams of having physical intercourse with a woman he knows or does not know; the same goes for women.\" If you dream of having sex with a man when you are pregnant, you are committing adultery.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLeviticus 15:16-24, 22:4 \"A man's nocturnal emission\" is classified as unclean, and the same is true for women.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t5. Whoever is born of God will never sin\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How can a person avoid committing adultery?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: He who must be \"born again\" and is born of God will not commit adultery.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 The regenerated new man is not of the flesh - refer to Romans 8:9<br \/>\n2 Abide in Christ Jesus--Refer to Romans 8:1<br \/>\n3 Hidden with Christ in God--Refer to Colossians 3:3<br \/>\n<p>\n\t4 He who is born of God has a spiritual body, without the passions and desires of the flesh. (The new man) neither marries nor is given in marriage. See 1 Corinthians 15:44 and Matthew 22:30.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t【Note】\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnyone who is born of God and resurrected has a spiritual body - refer to 1 Corinthians 15:44; the new man does not belong to the old body - refer to Romans 8:9, so the regenerated (new man) does not have the evil passions and desires of the flesh, and does not marry or marry. To marry is like an angel from heaven! The regenerated new man will not sin, nor will he commit adultery.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, the commandments of carnal ordinances:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 Thou shalt not kill\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said, \"People of this world marry and are given in marriage; but those who are reckoned worthy of that world neither marry nor are given in marriage to those who are alive from the dead; for they cannot die again, like the angels; and since they are resurrected, As the Son of God Luke 20:34-36.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Note:] New people who are reborn and resurrected cannot die again, just like angels. At that time, do you need to observe the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\"? No, right? You can't kill others, and others can't kill you. Your life is eternal and eternal, and there will be no more death or curse. Refer to Revelation 21:4, 22:3!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 Thou shalt not commit adultery\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tExample: People who like to smoke and people who don’t like to smoke. People who like to smoke have their flesh sold to sin (see Romans 7:14). They like the law of sin (see Romans 7:23) and their hearts follow The flesh likes smoking;\n<\/p>\nNote: Because the regenerated new man is a spiritual body and no longer has the evil passions and desires of the flesh, they neither marry nor marry, just like angels! Therefore, anyone who is regenerated will neither sin nor commit adultery.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tFor where there is no law, there is no transgression (see Romans 4:15)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe regenerated new man is already free from the law, and there is no need for you to keep the commandments (not to commit adultery) and the regulations of the flesh. Anyone who is born of God neither sins nor commits adultery. Do you understand this? Refer to 1 John 3:9, 5:18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 Thou shalt not steal\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: Those whom he predestined he also called; those he called he also justified; those he justified he also glorified. Romans 8:30. In this case, is there still stealing in the kingdom of God? Do you still need to abide by \"Thou shalt not steal\"? No need, right?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4 Thou shalt not bear false witness\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: The regenerated new man has the Father in him, the word of Christ in his heart, and the Holy Spirit renews himself to do things that please the Father! In this way, can he bear \"false witness\"? It is impossible, right! Because the Holy Spirit can understand all things, The Word of God is in us, and we can discern even the thoughts and intentions of our hearts. So do you still need to abide by these regulations? No need, right?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t5 Don’t be greedy\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: You who are born of God are all children of the Heavenly Father and are the inheritance of the Heavenly Father. He who did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things? Romans 8:32. In this way, if you have the inheritance of your heavenly Father, will you still covet other people’s things?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBrothers and sisters, remember to collect\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGospel transcript from:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tthe church in lord jesus christ\n<\/p>\n<br \/>\n---2023-01-07---","cover":"","description":"","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","views":"5","likes":"0","status":"0","can_comment":"0","create_at":"1735763976","update_at":"1735763976","lang":"en"},{"id":"30792","category_id":"34","tag_ids":"[\"482\"]","title":"Know Your Only True God","slug":"know-your-only-true-god","author":"admin","content":"<p>\n\tPeace to all brothers and sisters!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tToday we examine the fellowship and share \"Knowing the True God\"\n<\/p>\nLet’s open the Bible to John 17:3, turn it over and read together:<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThis is eternal life: to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1.

Now I tell you what you worship that you do not know.

Just like you poets, some people say: \"We are also born of him.\" Since we are God's children. Those who are born should not think that the divinity of God is like gold, silver, or stone carved by human craftsmanship and thought. When the world is ignorant, God does not watch, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent, for he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, and he will give trust to all men by raising him from the dead.

What to do about the transgressions of the flesh? Don’t we need to worry about them?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 Not imputing their (old man’s) trespasses to them (the new man), but having entrusted to us the message of reconciliation--Refer to 2 Corinthians 5:19<br \/>\n2 If we live by the Spirit, we must also walk by the Spirit - Reference Gal 5:25<br \/>\n3 Put to death the deeds of the body by the Holy Spirit--Refer to Romans 8:13<br \/>\n4 Mortify your members that are on earth - refer to Colossians 3:5<br \/>\n5 We (the old man) were crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live--Refer to Gal 2:20<br \/>\n6 Consider yourselves (old man) dead to sin - See Romans 6:11<br \/>\n7 Whoever hates his (old man’s sinful) life in this world must preserve his (new man) life for everlasting life. Reference about 12:25<br \/>\n<p>\n\t8 Code of Conduct for New Believers--Refer to Ephesians 4:25-32\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Old Testament] Therefore, in the Old Testament, there were laws and regulations, but no one was justified before God by the law. This is obvious. Therefore, Paul said that if you rely on these regulations to control the flesh, Lust has no effect whatsoever--Refer to Colossians 2:20-23\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why is it ineffective?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: For everyone who works by the law is under a curse... No one is justified before God by the law. This is obvious - refer to Galatians 3:10-11;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[New Testament] In the New Testament, you are also dead to the law through the body of Christ...and are now free from the law - refer to Romans 7:4,6! Since you have been freed from the law, you are now born again Christians have the presence of the Holy Spirit! If we live by the Holy Spirit, we should also walk by the Holy Spirit - see Galatians 5:25. That is to say, we should rely on the Holy Spirit to put to death all the evil deeds of the fleshly desires, hate the sinful life of the (old man), and preserve the (new man) to eternal life! (New man) By the Holy Spirit produce: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control! The fruits of the Holy Spirit! Amen. Galatians 5:22-23. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t9. Put the treasure in the earthen vessel\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe have this treasure in earthen vessels to show that this great power comes from God and not from us. 2 Corinthians 4:7\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is baby?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The \"treasure\" is the Holy Spirit of truth - refer to John 15:26-27\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is an earthen vessel?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: \"Earthen vessel\" means that God wants to use you as a precious vessel - refer to 2 Timothy 2:20-21! The treasure placed in the earthen vessel is the Holy Spirit placed on our regenerated new man.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why? Sometimes we fail to demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSuch as: healing diseases, casting out demons, performing miracles, speaking in tongues...etc.!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: This great power comes from God, not from us.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor example: When Christians first believed in Jesus, they would personally experience many visions and dreams, and many wonderful things would happen around them. But now it gradually appears less often or even disappears? The reason is that after we believed in Jesus, our hearts followed the flesh, cared about the things of the flesh, and followed the world. It was full of thorns, and we were unable to show the power of the Holy Spirit.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t10. Death activates in us to reveal the life of Jesus\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe always carry the death of Jesus with us so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in us. ...In this way, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. 2 Corinthians 4:10,12\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is initiating death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The death of Jesus is activated in us! How did Jesus die? Jesus saved us from sin and died on the cross for our sins. If we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection - See Romans 6:5. Being united to Him in the likeness of death means that death is active in us and we always carry the spirit of Jesus with us. Die! Take up your cross and be the way of the Lord. If you lose your old life for the gospel, you will gain the life of Jesus - refer to Mark 8:34-35. If you have the life of Jesus, you can reveal the life of Jesus! The life of the Holy Spirit Power is witnessing the life of Jesus! Amen.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"Before that day\", everyone must die once, and everyone in the world will experience physical \"birth, old age, sickness and death\" and even die due to other things; but Christians should pray more to the Lord Jesus and not let their physical body \"birth, old age\". .Sickness.Death\", let alone being tortured by the \"disease\" and dying of physical pain, dying in the hospital, or dying on the hospital bed; We should pray to the Lord Jesus to cause His death to be activated in our old man. We should be willing to take up our cross, follow Jesus, lose our old life for the truth and the gospel, and experience death with Christ! Perhaps when you are old, the best wish is to die physically in your sleep or to die naturally and peacefully in your sleep.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t11. The old man gradually becomes bad, and the new man gradually grows up\n<\/p>\nTherefore, we do not lose heart. Although the outer body is being destroyed, yet the inner body is being renewed day by day. 2 Corinthians 4:16<br \/>\n<p>\n\tNote:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Old man) The \"outer body\" is the visible body from the outside. Although it is destroyed, this old man's flesh gradually becomes bad due to the deceitfulness of lusts - refer to Ephesians 4:22\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(New Man) What is raised with Christ is the spiritual body - refer to 1 Corinthians 15:44; your life is hid with Christ in God - refer to Colossians 3:3; according to what is in me (original text: \"man\" \") - Reference Romans 7:22.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→The invisible (new man) born of God, joined to Christ, gradually grows into a man, fulfilling the stature of the full stature of Christ - refer to Ephesians 4:12-13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we do not lose heart. Although the outer body (the old man's flesh) is destroyed, the inner body (the reborn new man) is being renewed day by day and \"grows into a man.\" Our temporary and light sufferings (putting off the sufferings of the old man) will accomplish for us (the new man) an incomparable and eternal weight of glory. It turns out that we do not care about what we see (the old man), but we care about what we do not see (the new man); because what we see (the old man) is temporary, but what we do not see (the new man) is eternal. Refer to 2 Corinthians 4:16-18. Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t12. Christ appears, and the new man appears and enters eternal life\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Christ, who is our life, appears, you also will appear with him in glory.

Why do people die?\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why do people die?<br \/>\nAnswer: People die because of \"sin\".<br \/>\n<p>\n\tFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Where does our \"sin\" come from?<br \/>\nAnswer: It comes from the first ancestor Adam.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tJust as sin entered the world through one man, and death came through sin, so death came to all because all have sinned. Romans 5:12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Definition of \"crime\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) sin\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is sin?<br \/>\nAnswer: Breaking the law is sin.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tWhoever sins breaks the law; breaking the law is sin. 1 John 3:4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Sins unto death and sins (not) unto death\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray for him, and God will give him life; but if there is a sin that leads to death, I do not say that he should pray for him. All unrighteousness is sin, and there are sins that do not lead to death. 1 John 5:16-17\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the sin leading to death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: God makes a covenant with man! If a man \"breaks the covenant,\" the sin is a sin leading to death.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tlike:\n<\/p>\n1 Adam’s sin of breach of contract in the Garden of Eden--Refer to Genesis 2:17<br \/>\n2 God made a covenant with the Israelites (if anyone breaks the covenant, it will be a sin) - refer to Exodus 20:1-17<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3 The sin of not believing in the New Testament! --Refer to Luke 22:19-20 and John 3:16-18.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is a sin \"not\" leading to death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The transgressions of the flesh!\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why are the transgressions of the flesh (not) sins leading to death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Because you are already dead - refer to Colossians 3:3;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOur old human flesh was crucified with Christ with its passions and desires - refer to Gal 5:24; the body of sin was destroyed so that we would no longer be slaves to sin - refer to Romans 6:6;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Spirit of God lives in you, you are not carnal - see Romans 8:9;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNow it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me - Reference Gal 2:20.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGod and Us【New Testament】\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThen he said: I will remember their sins and their transgressions no more. Now that these sins have been forgiven, there are no more sacrifices for sin. Hebrews 10:17-18! Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. Escape from death\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How does one escape from death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Because the wages of sin is death - refer to Romans 6:23\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(If you want to be free from death, you must be free from sin; if you want to be free from sin, you must be free from the power of the law.)\n<\/p>\nDie! Where is your power to overcome?<br \/>\nDie! Where is your sting?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThe sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 1 Corinthians 15:55-56\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4. Escape from the power of the law\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to escape from the power of the law?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 Free from the law\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, my brethren, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might belong to others, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God. …But since we died to the law that bound us, we are now free from the law, so that we may serve the Lord according to the newness of spirit (spirit: or translated as the Holy Spirit) and not according to the old way of ceremony. . Romans 7:4,6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 Freedom from the Curse of the Law\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming the curse for us; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.” Galatians 3 :13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 Delivered from the law of sin and death\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. Romans 8:1-2\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t5. Rebirth\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What do you believe in rebirth?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: (Believe) the gospel is reborn!\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the gospel?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: What I also passed on to you was: First, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the Scriptures. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How did the resurrection of Jesus give birth to us?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has given us new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you. You who are kept by the power of God through faith will receive the salvation prepared to be revealed in the last time. 1 Peter 1:3-5\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How are we reborn?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 Born of water and the Spirit--Refer to John 3:5-8<br \/>\n2 Born from the truth of the gospel--refer to 1 Corinthians 4:15; James 1:18<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3 Born of God--refer to John 1:12-13; 1 John 3:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t6. Break away from the old man and his behavior\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to get rid of the old man and his behaviors?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection, knowing that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer work sin Servant; Romans 6:5-6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: We died, were buried, and were resurrected with Christ! Jesus rose from the dead and reborn us! In this way, the reborn (new man) has been separated from the (old man) and the behavior of the old man. Reference Colossians 3:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t7. The new man (does not belong to) the old man\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the old man?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: All flesh that comes from the roots of Adam’s flesh belongs to the old man.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is a newcomer?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: All members born from the last Adam (Jesus) are new people! Amen\n<\/p>\n1 Born of water and the Spirit--Refer to John 3:5-8<br \/>\n2 Born from the truth of the gospel--refer to 1 Corinthians 4:15; James 1:18<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3 Born of God--refer to John 1:12-13; 1 John 3:9\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why does the new man (not belong to) the old man?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: If the Spirit of God (i.e. the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of the Heavenly Father) dwells in you, you are no longer of the flesh (the old man of Adam), but the (new man) is of the Holy Spirit (that is, of the Holy Spirit, but of the Christ belongs to God the Father). If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. Refer to Romans 8:9. Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t8. The Holy Spirit and the Flesh\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 body\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Who does the body belong to?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The flesh belongs to the old man and has been sold to sin.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that the law is of the spirit, but I am of the flesh and have been sold to sin. Romans 7:14\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Where does the Holy Spirit come from?<br \/>\nAnswer: From God the Father! The new man belongs to the Holy Spirit<br \/>\n<p>\n\tBut when the Helper comes, whom I will send from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me. John 15:26\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 The conflict between the Holy Spirit and the lust of the flesh\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit lusteth against the flesh: these two are opposed to each other, so that you cannot do what you wish to do. Galatians 5:17\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What are the lusts of the old man’s flesh?<br \/>\nAnswer: The works of the flesh are obvious: adultery, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, fits of rage, factions, dissensions, heresies, and envy. words), drunkenness, carousing, etc. I told you before and I tell you now that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Galatians 5:19-21\n<p>\n\t4 The new man delights in the law of God; the old man obeys the law of sin\n<\/p>\nBecause according to the inner meaning (the original text is man) (that is, the regenerated new man), (the new man), I like the law of God; but I feel that there is another law in my body that is warring with the law in my heart and takes me captive. Make me conform to the law of sin in the members. I am so miserable! Who can save me from this body of death? Thank God, we can escape through our Lord Jesus Christ. In this way, I obey the law of God with my heart (new man), but my flesh (old man) obeys the law of sin. Romans 7:22-25<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: What is God’s law?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: \"The law of God\" is the law of the Holy Spirit, the law of release, and the fruit of the Holy Spirit - refer to Romans 8:2; the law of Christ - refer to Gal 6:2; the law of love - refer to Romans 13:10, Matthew 22:37-40 and 1 John 4:16;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhoever is born of God does not sin - refer to 1 John 3:9. \"The law of God\" is the law of love. The love of Jesus regenerates you, and whoever is born of God does not sin! In this way, not sinning → is the law of God! Anyone who is born of God will not break the law and sin. Do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(If there is the presence of the Holy Spirit, regenerated believers will understand as soon as they hear it, because as soon as God’s words are revealed, they will emit light and make fools understand. Otherwise, some people will not understand even if their lips are dry. Is this why? The same is true for some \"pastors or evangelists\". Their hearts are greasy, their ears are heavy, their eyes deliberately cannot see, and their ears do not want to hear. They are deceived by \"sin\", their hearts become hardened, and they become stubborn and stubborn. )\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the law of sin?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: He who breaks the law and does unrighteous things → He who breaks the law and commits sin is the law of sin. Reference John 1 3:4\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the law of death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below - Romans 8:2\n<\/p>\n<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">#.<\/span> .In the day you eat of it you will surely die--Genesis 2:17<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">#<\/span> ..For the wages of sin is death--Romans 6:23<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">#<\/span> ..If you do not believe that Jesus is the Christ, you will die in your sins - John 8:24<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">#<\/span> ..Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish!--Luke 13:5<br \/>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, if you do not repent → do not believe that Jesus is the Christ, do not believe in the gospel, and do not believe in the \"New Testament\"! You will all perish → this is the \"law of death\". Do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4 Sins of the Old Man’s Flesh\n<\/p>\nQuestion: The old man’s flesh obeyed the law of sin. If he sinned, do he have to confess his sins?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[John said: ] If we say that we (the old self) are sinless, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we (the old man) have not sinned, we regard God as a liar, and His word is not in us. 1 John 1:8-10\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Paul said: ] For we know that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, so that we (the new man) should no longer be slaves to sin. Romans 6:6; Brothers, it seems that we (the new man) are not debtors to the flesh to live according to the flesh. Romans 8:12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[John said] Whoever is born of God does not sin, because the word of God abides in him; nor can he sin, because (the new man) he is born of God. 1 John 3:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t【Note:】\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany people mistakenly think that these two passages in 1 John 1:8-10 and 3:9 are contradictory. In fact, they are not contradictory. What John said is correct.\n<\/p>\nThe \"former\" is for those who are not regenerated and have not believed in Jesus; while the \"latter\" is for those who believe in Jesus and have been regenerated (new people); and James 5:16 \"Confess your sins to one another\" is for those who believe in Jesus. The twelve tribes of Israel lived in 1:1.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnd Paul was well versed in the law and said, \"What was gain at first is now considered loss for the sake of Christ - refer to Philippians 3:5-7; Paul received a great revelation (the new man) and was caught up by God to the third heaven, \"the paradise of God\" -Refer to 2 Corinthians 12:1-4,\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd only the letters written by Paul: 1 If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are not in the flesh.\" 2 The Holy Spirit lusts against the flesh. 3 \"The old man is carnal and the new man is spiritual.\" 4 Flesh and blood cannot bear it. Kingdom of God, 5 The Lord Jesus also said that the flesh profiteth nothing. Therefore the wisdom which God gave him (Paul) wrote to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause the regenerated (new man) obeys the law of God and does not sin; while the flesh (old man) has been sold to sin, but obeys the law of sin. If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are not of the flesh - refer to Romans 8:9. That is, the (new man) does not belong to the flesh (the old man), and the (new man) does not owe any debt to the flesh (i.e., sin debt), to obey The flesh lives - see Romans 8:12.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn this way, the regenerated new man no longer \"confesses\" the sins of the old man's flesh. If you say you want to confess, a problem arises, because the flesh (old man) obeys the law of sin every day, and those who break the law and commit sins are guilty of \"sin.\" You will ask the precious blood of the Lord \"many times\" to blot out and cleanse your sins. When you behave in this way, you will treat the blood of Jesus' sanctifying covenant as \"normal\" and despise the Holy Spirit of grace. --Reference Hebrews 10:29,14! Therefore, Christians should not be foolish, nor should they grieve the Holy Spirit of God. They should be especially alert, careful, and discerning regarding matters concerning the \"covenant of life and death.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: I believe that my old man was crucified with Christ and the body of sin was destroyed. I am no longer the one who lives now. But now my old man is still alive in the flesh! I can still walk, work, eat, drink, sleep, and get married and have a family. Child! What about the young flesh? What about the young? The old can still do it, but the flesh sometimes gets sick! (For marriage issues, please refer to 1 Corinthians 7) I also know that the flesh has been sold to sin (Romans 7:14) , living in the flesh still likes to obey the law of sin and violate the law and commit sins. In this case, what should we do about the transgressions of our old human flesh? Shouldn’t we just ignore them?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: I will explain it in detail in the second lecture...\n<\/p>\nGospel Transcript:<br \/>\nWorkers of Jesus Christ!

He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ: just as God chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him; because of His love for us He chose us in Him He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will (Ephesians 1:3-5)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2: God’s grace\n<\/p>\nWe have redemption through the blood of this beloved Son, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the riches of his grace. This grace is given to us abundantly by God in all wisdom and understanding; it is all according to His own good pleasure, which He has predestined to make known to us the mystery of His will, so that in the fullness of time He may make heavenly things according to His plan. , everything on earth is united in Christ. In him we also have an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works out all things according to the counsel of his will, so that through us, who were first in Christ, we may receive his glory. He who hopes will be praised. (Ephesians 1:7-12)<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThree: Being sealed by the promised Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn Him you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, when you also believed in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

In which you walked according to the course of this world, in obedience to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit which now works in the sons of disobedience. We were all among them, indulging the lusts of the flesh, following the desires of the flesh and the heart, and by nature were children of wrath, just like everyone else. However, God, who is rich in mercy and loves us with great love, makes us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved. He also raised us up and seated us with us in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:1-6)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFive: Put on the armor given by God\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI have final words: Be strong in the Lord and in His power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you can stand against the devil's schemes. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand the enemy in the day of trouble, and having done all, to stand. So stand firm, girding your waist with truth, covering your breast with the breastplate of righteousness, and putting on your feet the shoes of the good news of peace.

This was the shape of His death.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How to be united with Him in the likeness of His death?\n<\/p>\nAnswer: By being \"baptized\" into the death of Jesus and being buried with Him;<br \/>\n<p>\n\t\"Being baptized\" means being crucified, died, buried, and resurrected with Christ! Amen.

Touch me and see! A soul has no bones and no flesh. You see, I do. ” Luke 24:39<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How can we be united with Him in His resurrection likeness?\n<\/p>\nAnswer: Eat the Lord’s supper!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tBecause Jesus’ flesh → saw neither corruption nor death – see Acts 2:31\n<\/p>\nWhen we eat the \"bread\" His body, we have the body of Jesus within us. When we drink the \"grape juice\" His blood in the cup, we have the life of Jesus Christ within our hearts. Amen! This is to be united with Him in the form of resurrection. Whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup, we will remain united until He comes again. Reference 1 Corinthians 11:26\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. (Belief) The old man is dead and has been freed from sin<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nQuestion: How do believers escape from sin?<br \/>\nAnswer: Jesus died for our sins, freeing us from them. Being united to him in the likeness of death, our old man was crucified with him, so that the body of sin might be destroyed, so that we might no longer be slaves to sin, for he who has died is freed from sin. Refer to Romans 6:6-7 and Col 3:3 for you are already dead...!<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. (Faith) Anyone born of God will never sin<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why does anyone who is born of God not sin?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n(1) Jesus used his own blood to wash away people’s sins (once). Reference Hebrews 1:3 and 9:12<br \/>\n(2) The unblemished blood of Christ cleanses your hearts (original text is \"conscience\") refer to Hebrews 9:14<br \/>\n(3) Once the conscience is cleansed, it no longer feels guilty - Hebrews 10:2<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why do I always feel guilty?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 Because you have the law, you are under the law and break the law, the law convicts you of sin, and the devil accuses you of sin. Reference Romans 4:15, 3:20, Revelation 12:10<br \/>\n2 The blood of Jesus only cleansed people's sins (once). You (do not) believe that His precious blood (once) became the eternal atonement for sins; you only listen to the preachers who speak nonsense and say \"His precious blood lasts forever.\" \"Efficacious\" → wash away sins (many times), blot out sins, and treat His blood as normal. Reference Hebrews 10:26-29<br \/>\n3 Those who feel guilty are not born again! That is, they have not been reborn as a (new man), they have not understood the gospel, and they have not understood the salvation of Christ; because they are still in the (old man) sinful body, in the evil passions and lusts of Adam; they are not in the holiness of Christ.<br \/>\n4 You have not (believed) that the old man was crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed... For he who has died has been freed from sin - Romans 6:6-7, for you have died... Colossians 3 :3<br \/>\n5 You must [consider] yourselves (the old man) to be dead to sin, but you must [consider] yourselves (the new man) to be alive to God in Christ Jesus. Romans 6:11<br \/>\nFor example: Jesus said to them, \"If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you say, 'We can see,' your sin remains.\" -- John 9:41<br \/>\n6 Everyone who sins violates the law and is not freed from the law (by faith) through Jesus. They are under the law and lie in the power of the evil one. From this, it becomes clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil. Reference John 1:10<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. Chaste virgins<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#006600;\">(1) 144,000 people<\/span> \n<\/p>\nThese men had not been tainted with women; they were virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men as firstfruits for God and for the Lamb. No lie can be found in their mouths; they are without blemish. Revelation 14:4-5<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Where did the above 144,000 people come from?\n<\/p>\nAnswer: The Lamb was purchased from man with his blood--1 Corinthians 6:20<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Who do the 144,000 people here represent?\n<\/p>\nAnswer: It typifies the saved Gentiles and all the saints! Amen<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#006600;\">(2) Christians who believe in the gospel and are born again are chaste virgins<\/span> \n<\/p>\nThe anger I feel for you is the anger of God. For I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as chaste virgins to Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:2<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5. Putting off the old man Adam<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#006600;\">(1) Experience→The old man is gradually put off<\/span> \n<\/p>\nQuestion: When did I put off my old man, Adam?<br \/>\nAnswer: I (believed in) being crucified, died, and buried with Christ, and thus put off the old man Adam; then believing (experience) that the death of Jesus started in me, and gradually put off the old man. See 2 Corinthians 4:4:10-11 and Ephesians 4:22<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#006600;\">(2) Experience→The newcomer gradually grows up<\/span> \n<\/p>\nIf the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are no longer of the flesh but of the Spirit. ...Refer to Romans 8:9 → Therefore, we do not lose heart. Although the outer body (old man) is being destroyed, the inner man (new man) is being renewed day by day. Our light and momentary sufferings will work for us an eternal weight of glory beyond compare. 2 Corinthians 4:16-17<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6. Eat the Lord’s Supper<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nJesus said, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, at the last day I will raise him up. My flesh is food, and my blood is drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I abide in him. John 6:53-56<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>7. Put on the new self and put on Christ<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nTherefore you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Galatians 3:26-27<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>8. Like to preach the gospel and make people believe in Jesus<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nThe most obvious characteristic of a reborn Christ is that he likes to preach Jesus to his family, relatives, classmates, colleagues, and friends, telling them to believe in the gospel and be saved and have eternal life.<br \/>\n(For example) Jesus came to them and said to them, \"All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. So go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ( Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit). Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you, and I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Matthew 28:18- 20<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>9. No longer worship idols<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nBorn-again Christians no longer worship idols, they only worship the Lord who created heaven and earth, the Lord Jesus Christ! Amen<br \/>\nYou were dead in your trespasses and sins, and he made you alive. In which you walked according to the course of this world, in obedience to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit which now works in the sons of disobedience. We were all among them, indulging the lusts of the flesh, following the desires of the flesh and the heart, and by nature were children of wrath, just like everyone else. However, God, who is rich in mercy and loves us with great love, makes us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved. He also raised us up and seated us with us in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:1-6<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>10. Love gatherings, studying the Bible, and praising God with spiritual songs<\/strong> \n<\/p>\nBorn-again Christians love one another and love to gather as members to listen to sermons, read and study the Bible, pray to God, and praise our God with spiritual songs!<br \/>\nthat my spirit may sing your praises and never be silent. I will praise you, O LORD, my God, forever! Psalm 30:12<br \/>\nLet the word of Christ dwell in your hearts richly, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing praises to God with your hearts filled with grace. Colossians 3:16<br \/>\n<p>\n\t<strong>11. We do not belong to the world<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(As the Lord Jesus said) I have given them your word. And the world hates them; because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to keep them from the evil one (or translated: from sin). They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. John 17:14-16\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>12. Waiting for the return of Christ with faith, hope, and love<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNow there are three things that always exist: faith, hope, and love, the greatest of which is love. --1 Corinthians 13:13\n<\/p>\nWe know that all creation groans and labors together until now. Not only that, even we who have the first fruits of the Spirit groan inwardly, waiting for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. Romans 8:22-23<br \/>\nHe who testifies this says, “Yes, I am coming quickly!” Amen! Lord Jesus, I want you to come!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tMay the grace of the Lord Jesus always be with all the saints.

Colossians 3:3<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Are our regenerated lives and bodies visible?\n<\/p>\nAnswer: The regenerated new man is hidden with Christ in God and is invisible.<br \/>\nIt turns out that we care not about what is seen, but about what is unseen; for what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:18<br \/>\n<p>\n\t(2) Our life appears\n<\/p>\nQuestion: When does our life manifest?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: When Christ appears, our lives will also appear.\n<\/p>\nWhen Christ, who is our life, appears, you also will appear with him in glory. Colossians 3:4<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Does life appear to have a body?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: There is a body!\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Is it Adam’s body? Or the body of Christ?<br \/>\nAnswer: It is the Body of Christ! Because He gave birth to us by the gospel, we are His members. Ephesians 5:30<br \/>\n<p>\n\tNote: What is in our hearts is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Spirit of Heavenly Father! The soul is the soul of Jesus Christ! The body is the immortal body of Jesus; therefore, our new man is not the soul body of the old man, Adam. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMay the God of peace sanctify you completely! And may your spirit, soul, and body (i.e., your reborn soul and body) be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ! He who calls you is faithful and will do it. 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Those who fell asleep in Jesus, Jesus brought with him\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Where are those who have fallen asleep in Jesus Christ?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Hidden with Christ in God!\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Where is Jesus now?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Jesus was resurrected and ascended to heaven. He is now in heaven, sitting at the right hand of God the Father. Our lives and the lives of those who have fallen asleep in Jesus are also in heaven. Reference Ephesians 2:6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why do some churches (such as Seventh-day Adventists) say that the dead sleep in graves until Christ comes again, and then they come out of the graves and are resurrected?\n<\/p>\nAnswer: Jesus will come down from heaven when he comes again, and concerning those who have fallen asleep in Jesus, of course he will be brought from heaven;<br \/>\n<p>\n\t【Because the work of redemption of Jesus Christ has been completed】\n<\/p>\nIf the dead are still sleeping in the tomb, their faith will be in big trouble. They will have to wait until the end of the millennium, the final judgment, when death and Hades will hand over the dead among them. If someone's name is not written in the book of life, he will was cast into the lake of fire. So, do you understand? Refer to Revelation 20:11-15<br \/>\n<p>\n\tWe do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, lest you should grieve like those who have no hope. If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even those who sleep in Jesus will God also bring with him. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Those who have fallen asleep in Christ, will they be resurrected with bodies?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: There is a body, a spiritual body, the body of Christ! Reference 1 Corinthians 15:44\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ will rise first. 1 Thessalonians 4:16\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(4) Those who are alive and remain will be transformed and put on the new man and appear in the blink of an eye.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNow I tell you a mysterious thing: we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in an instant, in the blink of an eye, when the last trumpet sounds. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed. This perishable must be put on (\"put on\") the incorruptible; this mortal must put on immortality. 1 Corinthians 15:51-53\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(5)We will see his true form\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Who does our true form look like?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Our bodies are the members of Christ and appear to be like Him!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDear brothers, we are children of God now, and what we will be in the future has not yet been revealed; but we know that when the Lord appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him as He is. 1 John 3:2 and Philippians 3:20-21\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\talright! \"Believe in the Gospel\" is shared here.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet us pray together: Thank you Abba Heavenly Father, thank you the Savior Jesus Christ, and thank the Holy Spirit for always being with us!

Having put an end to enmity on the cross, we have been reconciled to God through the cross.

Remove what?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Blot out the writings in the statutes that are against us and are harmful to us, and remove them.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What was the “purpose” of Jesus “blotting out” the laws, ordinances and writings, taking them away and nailing them to the cross?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Anyone who sins breaks the law; breaking the law is sin. 1 John 3:4\n<\/p>\nRefer to Revelation 12:10 because Satan the devil is before God day and night accusing → brothers and sisters → Is it against the law? Accuse you with laws and regulations and condemn you to death? Satan has to find the laws, regulations and letters as \"evidence\" to prove that you have violated the law before the judgment seat → condemn you to death; and love our God, Lord Jesus Christ! He blotted out the statutes and letters of the law, the evidence that accused us and condemned us to death, and took them away, nailing them to the cross. In this way, Satan will not be able to use \"evidence\" to accuse you, nor will he be able to convict you or condemn you to death. So, do you understand?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tYou were dead in your trespasses and uncircumcision of the flesh, but God has made you alive together with Christ, having forgiven you (or translated: us) all our trespasses, and having blotted out all that is in the law Take away the writings (evidences of guilt) that are written against us and against us, and nail them to the cross.

But since we died to the law by which we are bound, we are now free from the law... Romans 7:4 ,6<br \/>\n<p>\n\tChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming the curse for us; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.” Galatians 3 :13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(8) Obtain the sonship of God\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to obtain sonship?<br \/>\nAnswer: To redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive sonship.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tWhen the fullness of time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. Galatians 4:4-5\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why should those under the law be redeemed?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 Whoever commits sin breaks the law, and the violation of the law is sin. 1 John 3:4<br \/>\n2 Everyone who works according to the law is under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law.” No one is cursed. Being justified before God by the law is evident; for the Scripture says, \"The righteous shall live by faith.\" Galatians 3:10-11<br \/>\n3 For the law provokes wrath (or translation: causes punishment)<br \/>\nSo →→<br \/>\n4 Where there is no law, there is no transgression - Romans 4:15<br \/>\n5 Without the law, sin is not considered sin - Romans 5:13<br \/>\n6 For without the law sin is dead - Romans 7:8<br \/>\n<p>\n\t7 Whoever sins without the law will perish without the law; and whoever sins under the law will be judged according to the law. Reference Romans 2:12\n<\/p>\n(The Great Judgment of the Last Day: Brothers and sisters should be sober and pay attention. Those who are (not) under the law, that is, those who are in Jesus Christ, will be resurrected and reign with Christ for a thousand years before the millennium; Those who are under the law will have to wait until \"after\" the Millennium. These dead people will be handed over and judged according to their deeds under the law and their transgressions and sins. If anyone's name is not recorded, In the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire and perished).<br \/>\nIf you do not believe that this [gospel] is the power of God, please do not \"weep and gnash your teeth\" on the Day of Judgment. Refer to Revelation 20:11-15<br \/>\nSo, do you understand?<br \/>\n<p>\n\talright! Share it here today\n<\/p>\nLet us pray together: Thank you Heavenly Father! He sent his only begotten Son, Jesus, who was born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, to be freed from the law, and to give us sonship! Amen.<br \/>\nFor where there is no law, there is no transgression; where there is no law, there is no sin; where there is no law, there is no sin; where there is no law, there is no sin, and there is no curse.<br \/>\nHeavenly Father calls us to pray in the Holy Spirit in His eternal kingdom, in the love of Jesus Christ, and to praise our God with spiritual songs in the temple, Hallelujah!

Don’t be surprised when I say, “You must be born again.” John 3:6-7\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why must we be reborn?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 Unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God - John 3:3<br \/>\n2 Cannot enter the kingdom of God - John 3:5<br \/>\n3 Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God - 1 Corinthians 15:50<br \/>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the Lord Jesus said: “Do not be surprised that you must be born again.”\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf a person is not regenerated, he does not have the Holy Spirit. Without the guidance of the Holy Spirit, you will not understand the Bible. No matter how many times you read it, you will not understand the Bible or understand what the Lord Jesus said. For example, the disciples who followed Jesus at the beginning did not understand what Jesus said. When Jesus was resurrected and ascended to heaven, and the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost, they were filled with the Holy Spirit and received power, and then they understood what the Lord Jesus said. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why cannot flesh and blood inherit the kingdom of God?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The perishable (cannot) inherit the incorruptible.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is perishable?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The Lord Jesus said! What is born of the flesh is the flesh. Our flesh is born of our parents → we were created from the dust of Adam. Because of sin, Adam’s flesh will decay and see death, so he cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Did Jesus also have a body of flesh and blood?<br \/>\nAnswer: Jesus was born of the Heavenly Father, came down from Jerusalem in heaven, was conceived by a virgin and was born by the Holy Spirit. He is the Word incarnate, he is spiritual, holy, sinless, incorruptible, and does not see death! Reference Acts 2:31<br \/>\nOur flesh, which came from the dust of Adam, has been sold to sin, and the wages of sin is death. Therefore, our flesh is corruptible and mortal. The body created by flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. So, do you understand?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How can we inherit the kingdom of God?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Must be reborn!\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How are we born again?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Believe in Jesus! Believe the gospel, understand the word of truth, and receive the promised Holy Spirit as a seal. We cry out: \"Abba, Father!\" The Holy Spirit testifies with our hearts that we are children of God - Romans 8:15-16; Everything from God Whoever is born does not sin, amen! Refer to 1 John 3:9. This proves that you have been born again. Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe will study and share with brothers and sisters in detail about \"Rebirth\" in the future. Well, I will share it here today.\n<\/p>\nLet us pray together: Dear Abba Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, thank the Holy Spirit for guiding us children to believe the gospel and understand the way of truth, allowing us to receive the promised Holy Spirit as a seal, become children of God, and understand rebirth! Only those who are born of water and the Spirit can see the kingdom of God and enter the kingdom of God.

Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, in order that we might walk in newness of life, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father. Romans 6:3-4\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to live with Christ?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: \"Being baptized\" means testifying to die with Him and testifying to living with Christ! Amen\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. You were dead in your trespasses and uncircumcision of the flesh, but God made you alive together with Christ, having forgiven you (or us) all our trespasses; Colossians 2:12-13.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Formally united with Christ\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection; Romans 6:5\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What was the shape of Jesus’ death?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Jesus died on the cross, and this was the shape of His death!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How to be united with Him in the form of His death?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Use the method of believing in the Lord! When you believe in Jesus and the gospel, and are \"baptized\" into the death of Christ, you are united with Him in the form of death, and your old man is crucified with Him.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: What is the shape of Jesus’ resurrection?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Resurrection is the spiritual body\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe body that is sown refers to the body of Adam, the old man, and the body that is resurrected refers to the body of Christ, the new man. If there is a physical body, there must also be a spiritual body. So, do you understand? Reference 1 Corinthians 15:44\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Jesus’ flesh is imperishable\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tForeknowing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ and said: \"His soul was not left in Hades, nor did his body see corruption.\" ’ Acts 2:31\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) The shape of Jesus’ resurrection\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look at my hands and my feet, you will know that it is really me. Touch me and see! A soul has no bones and no flesh. You see, I do. ” Luke 24:39\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to be united with Him in His resurrection likeness?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Because Jesus’ flesh did not see corruption or death!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we eat the Lord’s Supper, the Holy Communion, we eat His body and drink the Lord’s blood! We have the life of Christ within us, and this life (which has nothing to do with Adam’s flesh and blood). The regenerated new man is the flesh and blood of Jesus. This is to be united with Christ in the likeness of his resurrection. Until Christ comes and Christ appears in His true form, our bodies will also appear and appear in glory with Christ. Amen! So, do you understand? See 1 John 3:2, Col 3:4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. Our resurrection life is hidden with Christ in God\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause you have died (that is, the old man has died), your life (the resurrection life with Christ) is hidden with Christ in God. So, do you understand? Reference Colossians 3:3\n<\/p>\nLet us pray to God together: Thank you Abba Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, and thank the Holy Spirit for always being with us! Lead us into all the truth and understand that if we believe in dying with Christ, we will also believe in living with Christ; by being baptized into death, we are united to him in the likeness of death; we eat the Lord’s supper, eat the Lord’s body and drink The blood of the Lord will also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection!

Romans 4:25\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) God’s righteousness is based on faith, so that faith\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Because the righteousness of God is revealed in this gospel; this righteousness is by faith from faith to faith. As it is written: “The righteous shall live by faith.” Romans 1:16-17\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is based on faith and leads to faith?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy faith → To be saved by faith in the gospel is to be born again!\n<\/p>\n1 Born of water and the Spirit - John 3:5-7<br \/>\n2 Born from the faith of the gospel - 1 Corinthians 4:15<br \/>\n3 Born of God--John 1:12-13<br \/>\nSo that faith → faith in the Holy Spirit is renewed and glorified!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHe saved us; not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. Titus 3:5\n<\/p>\n(3)Introduction of Yongyi<br \/>\n<p>\n\t“Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and Anoint the Holy One Daniel 9:24.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What does it mean to stop sin?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Stop means to stop, there is no more offense!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy dying to the law that binds us through the body of Christ, we are now free from the law... Where there is no law, there is no transgression. Reference Romans 4:15 . So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: What does it mean to eliminate sin?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: To cleanse means to cleanse. The unblemished blood of Christ cleanses your heart. If your conscience is clean, you will no longer feel guilty. This is called the cleansing of sins. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMuch more, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your hearts from dead works so that you may serve the living God? ...If not, wouldn’t the sacrifices have stopped long ago? Because the worshipers’ consciences have been cleansed and they no longer feel guilty. Hebrews 9:14, 10:2\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What does it mean to atone for sins?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Redemption means substitution, redemption. God made the sinless Jesus to become sin for us, and through Jesus’ death, we atone for our sins. Reference 2 Corinthians 5:21\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the introduction of Yongyi?<br \/>\nAnswer: \"Eternal\" means eternal, and \"righteousness\" means justification!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAtoning for sins and eradicating the seed of sin (originally Adam’s seed); now bring in the word of God. The original word is “seed” so that you may be justified forever. If you are justified forever, you will have eternal life! Amen. In this way, you understand. Do you understand? Reference John 1:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(4) Already washed, sanctified, and justified by the Spirit of God\n<\/p>\nQuestion: When are we sanctified, justified, justified?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Sanctification means being holy without sin;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJustification means becoming the righteousness of God; justification means that you become the righteousness of God, and only then will God declare you righteous! Just like when God created man from dust, God called Adam \"man\" after he became a \"man\"! So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo were some of you; but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. 1 Corinthians 6:11\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(5) Let us be justified freely\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; but are now justified freely by God’s grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God established Jesus as the propitiation by virtue of the blood of Jesus and through man’s faith to demonstrate God’s righteousness; because He patiently tolerated the sins committed by people in the past in order to demonstrate His righteousness in the present time. that he himself may be known to be righteous, and that he may also justify those who believe in Jesus. Romans 3:23-26\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe pray together to God: Thank you Abba Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, and thank the Holy Spirit for guiding us into all the truth and understand and believe the gospel! The resurrection of Jesus justifies us. God’s righteousness is based on faith, and we are saved by believing in the gospel! So much so that believing and believing in the renewal of the Holy Spirit brings us glory! Amen\n<\/p>\nThank you Lord Jesus Christ for having done the work of redemption for us, enabling us to put an end to our sins, eliminate our sins, atone for our sins, and introduce eternal righteousness. Those who are eternally justified will have eternal life! The righteousness of God is freely given to us, so that we have been washed, sanctified, and justified through the Spirit of God.

You see, isn’t our “sinful body” still alive today?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: God’s gospel is preached to you! \"The \"purpose\" of the gospel tells you that the old man has died, the body of sin has been destroyed, and you are no longer a slave to sin. It tells you to believe the gospel and use the method of believing in the Lord to believe. To unite and use (faith) in the likeness of death. Be united with Christ and be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection. Do you understand this? See Romans 6:5-7.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: When did we put off the old man?<br \/>\nAnswer: When you believe in Jesus, believe in the gospel, and understand the truth, Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day! You were resurrected with Christ. When you were reborn, you had already put off the old man. You believe that this gospel is the power of God to save you, and you are willing to be \"baptized\" into Christ and be united with Him in the likeness of His death; you will also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection. so,<br \/>\n<p>\n\t\"Being baptized\" is an act that testifies that you have put off the old man and your old self. Do you understand clearly? Reference Romans 6:3-7\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What are the behaviors of the old man?<br \/>\nAnswer: The evil passions and desires of the old man.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThe works of the flesh are obvious: adultery, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, dissensions, heresies, and envy. , drunkenness, revelry, etc. I told you before and I tell you now that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Galatians 5:19-21\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) The reborn new man does not belong to the old man’s flesh\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How do we know that we are not of the old human flesh?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are no longer of the flesh but of the Spirit. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. Romans 8:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The Spirit of God\" is the Spirit of the Father, the Spirit of Jesus. Jesus asked the Holy Spirit sent by the Father to live in your hearts → you are born again:\n<\/p>\n1 Born of water and the Spirit - John 3:5-7<br \/>\n2 Born from the faith of the gospel - 1 Corinthians 4:15<br \/>\n3 Born of God - John 1:12-13<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThe regenerated new man no longer belongs to the old flesh, the dead body of sin, or the destroyed body; the new man born of God belongs to the Holy Spirit, to Christ, and to God the Father! It is holy and without Sinful, eternal life! Amen. Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) The new man gradually grows; the old man gradually destroys\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Where do the regenerated new ones grow up?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The \"regenerated new man\" lives in Christ. The body has not yet appeared, and you cannot see it with the naked eye, because the regenerated \"new man\" is the spiritual body, the resurrected body of Christ. We are members of Christ and are together with Christ. Hidden in God and gradually growing; refer to Colossians 3:3-4, 1 Corinthians 15:44\n<\/p>\nAs for the visible sinful body of the old man, it undergoes death and its outer body is gradually destroyed. The old man is the body of Adam. The flesh of the old man came from Adam. It was originally dust and will eventually return to dust. So, do you understand? Reference Genesis 3:19<br \/>\n<p>\n\tRefer to the following two verses:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we do not lose heart. Although the outer body is being destroyed, the inner heart (that is, the Spirit of God dwelling in the heart) is being renewed day by day. 2 Corinthians 4:16\n<\/p>\nIf you have listened to his word, received his teachings, and learned his truth, you must put off your old self in your former conduct, which is gradually getting worse through the deceitfulness of lust.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tEphesians 4:21-22\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: Brothers and sisters! The regenerated new man has put off the old man and the behaviors of the old man. It is difficult to understand here! If people who are enlightened by the Holy Spirit see and hear, they will naturally understand. We will explain it in detail when we share \"Rebirth\" in the future. It will be clearer and easier for people to understand.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet us pray together: Dear Abba Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, thank the Holy Spirit for constantly illuminating our spiritual eyes and opening our minds so that we can see and hear the servants you send to preach spiritual truth and enable us to understand the Bible. We understand that Christ was crucified and died for our sins and was buried, so that we have put off the old man and its behaviors; we have been reborn through Christ’s resurrection from the dead, and the Spirit of God lives in our hearts, and we experience The regenerated new man \"lives in Christ, is gradually renewed and grows, and grows to be full of the stature of Christ; it also experiences the putting off of the outer body of the old man, which is gradually destroyed. The old man was dust when he came from Adam, and will return to dust.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

Repent and believe the gospel!\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20231028074051653.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLecture 5: The gospel frees us from the law and its curse\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Is it good to be free from the law? Or is it better to keep the law?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Freedom from the law.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n1 Everyone who works by the law is under a curse, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law.” Galatians Book 3:10<br \/>\n2 It is evident that no one is justified before God by the law; for it is said, “The righteous shall live by faith.” Galatians 3:11<br \/>\n3 Therefore by the works of the law no flesh will be justified before God, for the law is a convict of sin. Romans 3:20<br \/>\n4 You who seek to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ and have fallen from grace. Galatians 5:4<br \/>\n5 For the law was not made for the righteous, \"that is, the children of God,\" but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for the parricide and murderer, for the sexually immoral and fornicator, for the robber or for any other thing that is contrary to righteousness. 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Break away from Adam’s covenant-breaking law\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Free from what law?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: To be freed from the sin that leads to death is Adam’s “breaking of the covenant” law. God commanded Adam! (But you shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day you eat from it you will surely die!\"), this is a commandment law. Genesis 2:17\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Why are all humans under the curse of the law when the “first ancestors” broke the law?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: This is just like sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and death came from sin, so death came to everyone because everyone sinned. Romans 5:12\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is sin?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Breaking the law is sin → Anyone who sins breaks the law; breaking the law is sin. 1 John 3:4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAll have sinned, and in Adam all were under the curse of the law and died.\n<\/p>\nDie! Where is your power to overcome?<br \/>\nDie! Where is your sting?<br \/>\nThe sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.<br \/>\nIf you want to be free from death, you must be free from sin.<br \/>\nIf you want to be free from sin, you must be free from the law of sin's power.<br \/>\nAmen! So, do you understand?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tReference 1 Corinthians 15:55-56\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Being freed from the law and the curse of the law through the body of Christ\n<\/p>\nMy brethren, you also are dead to the law through the body of Christ... But since we died to the law by which we are bound, we are now free from the law... See Romans 7: 4,6<br \/>\n<p>\n\tChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming the curse for us; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.” Galatians 3 :13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Redeemed those who were under the law so that we could receive sonship\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive adoption as sons. Galatians 4:4-5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, the gospel of Christ frees us from the law and its curse. Advantages of being free from the law:\n<\/p>\n1 Where there is no law, there is no transgression. Romans 4:15<br \/>\n2 Where there is no law, sin is not counted. Romans 5:13<br \/>\n3 For without the law sin is dead. Romans 7:8<br \/>\n4 Whoever does not have the law and does not follow the law perish. Romans 2:12<br \/>\n5 Whoever sins under the law will be judged according to the law. Romans 12:12<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe pray together to God: Thank you Heavenly Father for sending your beloved Son, Jesus, who was born under the law, and redeemed us from the law and the curse of the law through the death and curse of Christ’s body hanging on the tree. Christ rose from the dead to regenerate us and make us righteous! Obtain the adoption as the son of God, be released, be free, be saved, be reborn, and have eternal life.

Psalm 51:17 The sacrifice God requires is a broken spirit; you, O God, will not despise a broken and contrite heart.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to correct it?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Believe in the gospel! \"Repentance\" does not mean asking you to reform, improve, or change yourself. You can never change your \"sins\" on your own. The real meaning of \"repentance\" is for you to believe the gospel. The gospel is the power of God to save everyone who believes. Believing in the gospel → frees us from sin, from the law and the curse of the law, and from the old man and the old self. Acts, escape from Satan, escape from the influence of Satan in the darkness of Hades; resurrect with Christ, be reborn, be saved, put on the new man and put on Christ, receive the sonship of God, and obtain eternal life! Amen.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→This is true \"repentance\"! Be renewed in your mind and put on the new self in true righteousness and holiness - refer to Ephesians 4:23-24\n<\/p>\nIt was the old man, now it is the new man;<br \/>\nOnce in sin, now in holiness;<br \/>\nOriginally in Adam, now in Christ.<br \/>\nBelief in the gospel → repentance!<br \/>\nBe transformed → Previously you were a son of Adam who was made of dust;<br \/>\n<p>\n\tNow the son of Jesus, the last Adam. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to believe the gospel?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Believe in the gospel! Just believe in Jesus!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe that Jesus Christ, sent by God, has done the work of redemption for us (to save his people from their sins). This \"work of redemption\" is the gospel! Amen. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How do we believe in the work of redemption? How do we work?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Jesus answered, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.” John 6:29\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to understand this verse?<br \/>\nAnswer: Believe in Jesus sent by God to do the work of redemption for us!<br \/>\nI believed: God’s work of salvation is at work in me, and the “wage” of Jesus’ work is imputed to those who “believe”, and God counts me as having worked → I am the same as God. Work, God’s work. Amen! Do you understand this?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo Paul says in Romans 1:17! The righteousness of God is “by faith→saved by faith!”; and due to faith→belief, the Holy Spirit operates “walking with God” to do the work of renewal, so that you can receive glory, rewards, and crowns. This is what God says to those who believe. Do you understand the mystery of the work in the body?\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How (faith) do we count as co-workers and walk with God?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Believe in Jesus Christ sent by God to do the work of redemption. Christ died for our sins and freed us from our sins.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1)The Lord laid the sins of all people on Jesus\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe all like sheep have gone astray; each one has turned to his own way; the Lord has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all. Isaiah 53:6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Christ died “for” all\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor the love of Christ compels us; for we consider that since one died for all, one died for all; 2 Corinthians 5:14\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) The dead are freed from sin\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor we know that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should no longer serve sin; for he who has died has been freed from sin. Romans 6:6-7\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Note:] Jehovah God laid the sins of all people on Jesus, and Jesus was crucified for them all, so that all died - 2 Corinthians 5:14 → Those who have died are freed from sin - Romans 6:7; “all” died, and all were freed from sin. Amen! You have seen and heard it. This is the gospel sent by God’s servants to tell you that you have been freed from sin. If you believe “this gospel”, the “wage” of Jesus’ work will be attributed to you. This gospel is God’s salvation. Power operates on those who \"believe\". This is the mystery of God's salvation. Do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, this gospel is the power of God to save everyone who believes that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, so that we have been freed from sin. You understand the pattern of this \"doctrine\". If you don't believe that this gospel has freed you from sin, you will be condemned. Your sin has been determined and you will be judged at the end of the day. Do you understand it?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet us pray to God together: Dear Abba, Heavenly Father! You have laid the sin of all people on Jesus Christ, who died for our sins, so that we all have been freed from our sins. Amen! Blessed are those who see, hear, and believe this gospel. The \"wages\" of Jesus' redemption work are returned to the body of those who believe. This is co-working with God and doing God's work.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ! Amen\n<\/p>\nGospel dedicated to my dear mother<br \/>\n<p>\n\tBrothers and sisters!

The gospel is the power of God\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the gospel?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: (Paul said) What I also passed on to you is: First of all, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the Scriptures. 15:3-4\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the power of the gospel?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Resurrection of the dead\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tConcerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead. Romans 1:3-4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Believe in Jesus’ resurrection from the dead\n<\/p>\nLater, as the eleven disciples were sitting at table, Jesus appeared to them and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after his resurrection. Then he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Mark 16:14-15<br \/>\nThomas wondered about Jesus’ resurrection:<br \/>\n<p>\n\tEight days later, the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them, and the doors were shut. Jesus came and stood in the midst and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put out your finger and touch my hands; stretch out your hand and put it in my side.” \"Do not doubt, but believe!\" Thomas said to him, \"My Lord, my God!\" Jesus said to him, \"Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.\" 20:26-29\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Believe in this gospel and you will be saved\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Believe and be baptized and be saved\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHe who believes and is baptized will be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned. These signs will follow those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink any poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover. ” Mark 16:16-18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Believe in Jesus and have eternal life\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Anyone who lives and believes in Jesus will never die\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" John 11:25- 26\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Do you understand what the Lord Jesus said? If you don’t understand, listen carefully)\n<\/p>\nSo Paul said!

As it is written: “The righteous shall live by faith.”\n<p>\n\tLet us pray together: Thank you Lord Jesus for dying for our sins, being buried, and rising again on the third day!

Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom of heaven\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit and preached the gospel\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor; he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty the oppressed, to proclaim the favor of God The Jubilee Year of Nirvana” Luke 4:18-19.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to understand this verse?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\nJesus was baptized in the Jordan River, filled with the Holy Spirit, and after being led into the wilderness to be tempted, began to preach the gospel of the kingdom of heaven!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\"The Spirit of the Lord (that is, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit)<br \/>\nIn me (i.e. Jesus),<br \/>\nBecause He (that is, Heavenly Father) has anointed me,<br \/>\nAsk me to preach the gospel to the poor (meaning they are naked and have nothing, no life and eternal life); refer to Revelation 3:17<br \/>\n<p>\n\tI am sent to report:\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What good news did Jesus report?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: The captives will be released\n<\/p>\n1 Those who were taken captive by the devil,<br \/>\n2 Those who are imprisoned by the powers of darkness and Hades,<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3 What death has taken away will be released.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe blind gain sight: that is, no one in the Old Testament saw God, but in the New Testament, now they have seen Jesus, the Son of God, saw light, and believed in Jesus to have eternal life.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet those who are oppressed be set free: those who are oppressed by the slaves of \"sin\", those who are cursed and bound by the law, be set free, and declare the Jubilee of God's favor!

Mark 1:1\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Believe in the gospel. What do you believe in?<br \/>\nAnswer: Belief in the gospel →→ is (belief in) Jesus! The name of Jesus is the gospel. The name \"Jesus\" means: because he will save his people from their sins. Amen! Do you understand this? See Matthew 1:21<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why is Jesus the beginning of the gospel?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1. Jesus is the eternal God\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1The God who exists and exists\n<\/p>\nGod said to Moses, “I am who I am”; Exodus 3:14<br \/>\nQuestion: When did Jesus exist?<br \/>\nAnswer: Proverbs 8:22-26<br \/>\n“In the beginning of the Lord’s creation,<br \/>\nIn the beginning, before all things were created, there was me (that is, there was Jesus).<br \/>\nFrom eternity, from the beginning,<br \/>\nBefore the world was, I was established.<br \/>\nThere is no abyss, no fountain of great waters, from which I was born.<br \/>\nBefore the mountains were laid, before the hills came into existence, I was born.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tBefore the LORD created the earth and its fields and the soil of the world, I gave birth to them. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 Jesus is Alpha and Omega\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"I am Alpha and Omega, the Almighty, who was, and who was, and who is to come,\" says the Lord God. Revelation 1:8\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 Jesus is the first and the last\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI am Alpha and Omega; I am the first and the last; I am the beginning and the end. ” Revelation 22:13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Jesus’ Creation Work\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Who created the worlds?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Jesus created the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 Jesus created the worlds\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGod, who in ancient times spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in many ways, has now spoken to us in these last days through his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he created all the worlds. Hebrews 1:1-2\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 All things were created by Jesus\n<\/p>\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth - Genesis 1:1<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThrough Him (Jesus) all things were made; and without Him nothing was made that was made. About 1:3\n<\/p>\n3 God created man in his own image and likeness<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGod said: “Let us create man in our image (referring to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds in the air, over the livestock on the earth, and over all the earth. All insects that crawl on the ground.”<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. Genesis 1:26-27\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t【Note:】\n<\/p>\nThe previous \"Adam\" was created in the image and likeness of God Himself (Jesus). Adam was the \"shadow\" of God's image and likeness. We start by following the \"shadow\" to find the true image of the original thing. Real body! --Refer to Colossians 2:17, Hebrews 10:1, Romans 10:4.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tWhen the “shadow” is revealed, it is → the last Adam Jesus! The previous Adam was a \"shadow\" → the last Adam, Jesus → is the real Adam, so Adam is the son of God! See Luke 3:38. In Adam all died because of \"sin\"; in Christ all will be resurrected because of \"rebirth\"! See 1 Corinthians 15:22. So, I wonder if you understand it?\n<\/p>\nThose who are enlightened by the Holy Spirit will understand when they see and hear, but some people will not understand even if their lips are dry. Those who don’t understand can listen slowly and pray to God more. He who seeks will find it, and the Lord will open the door to him who knocks! But you must not oppose the true way of God. Once people oppose the true way of God and do not accept the love of the truth, God will give them a wrong heart and make them believe in falsehood. These people will continue to resist God. They will Do you believe that you will never understand the gospel or rebirth until you die? Refer to 2:10-12.<br \/>\n(For example, 1 John 3:9, 5:18 Whoever is born of God \"neither shall sin nor shall he sin\"; many people say that \"whoever is born of God\" will still sin. What is the reason? Can you understand? ? Do you understand rebirth? If you are not born again, you cannot enter the kingdom of God. Do you believe it? )<br \/>\nJust like Judas, who had followed Jesus for three years and betrayed Him, and the Pharisees who opposed the truth, they did not understand that Jesus was the Son of God, the Christ, and the Savior until their death.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tFor example, the \"tree of life\" is the true image of the original thing. There is a \"shadow\" of the tree under the tree of life; the \"shadow\" of the previous Adam is revealed, which is the last Adam → Jesus! Jesus is the true image of the original thing. Our (old man) is born of the flesh of Adam and is also a \"shadow\"; our reborn (new man) is born of the gospel of Jesus and is the body of Christ, the real me, and the children of God. Amen! So, do you understand? Reference 1 Corinthians 15:45\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. Jesus’ work of redemption\n<\/p>\n1 Mankind fell in the Garden of Eden<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnd he said to Adam, “Because you obeyed your wife and ate of the tree, of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you;<br \/>\nYou must labor all your life to get food from the ground.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThe earth will bring forth thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the herbs of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread until you return to the ground, from which you were born. You are dust, and to dust you will return. ” Genesis 3:17-19\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 As soon as sin entered the world from Adam, death came to everyone\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJust as sin entered the world through one man, and death came through sin, so death came to all because all have sinned. Romans 5:12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. God gave his only begotten son, Jesus. Believe in Jesus and you will have eternal life.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to convict the world of sin. He is saved. John 3:16-17\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4. Jesus is the first love\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 first love\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, there is one thing I have to blame you for: you have left your first love. Revelation 2:4\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the first love?<br \/>\nAnswer: “God” is love (John 4:16)! Jesus is both human and God! So, the first love is Jesus!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tIn the beginning, you had the hope of salvation \"by\" believing in Jesus; later, you had to rely on your own behavior \"to believe\". If you leave \"faith\", you will leave Jesus, and you will leave your original love. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2 The original command\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What was the original order?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: We should love one another. This is the command you heard from the beginning. 1 John 3:11\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3 Love God. Love neighbor. Love neighbor as yourself.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and the greatest commandment. The greatest. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” Matthew 22:36-40.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo \"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is Jesus! Amen, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNext, we will continue to share the gospel text: \"Believe in the Gospel\" Jesus is the beginning of the gospel, the beginning of love, and the beginning of all things! Jesus! This name is \"gospel\" → to save your people from their sins! Amen\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet us pray together: Thank you Abba Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, thank the Holy Spirit for enlightening us and leading us to know that Jesus Christ is: the beginning of the gospel, the beginning of love, and the beginning of all things!

They said, \"Lord, always give us this food!\" ” Jesus said, “I am the bread of life.” Whoever comes to me will never be hungry; whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. John 6:33-35\n<\/p>\nQuestion: Jesus is the Bread of Life! So is \"manna\" also the bread of life?<br \/>\nAnswer: The \"manna\" God dropped in the wilderness in the Old Testament is a type of the bread of life and a type of Christ, but \"manna\" is a \"shadow\" → the \"shadow\" appears to be Jesus Christ, and Jesus is the real manna. , is the true food of life! So, do you understand?<br \/>\nFor example, in the Old Testament, the \"gold pot of manna, Aaron's budding rod, and the two tablets of the law\" stored in the ark of the covenant all typified Christ. Reference Hebrews 9:4<br \/>\n“Manna” is a shadow and a type, not the real bread of life. The Israelites died after eating “manna” in the wilderness.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tTherefore the Lord Jesus said: \"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness and died. This is the bread that came down from heaven. If you eat it, you will not die. Do you understand this? John 6:47-50.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1)The bread of life is the body of Jesus\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is the bread of life?<br \/>\nAnswer: The body of Jesus is the bread of life, and the blood of Jesus is our life! Amen<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<p>\n\tI am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. So the Jews argued among themselves, saying, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" ” John 6:51-52\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Eating the Lord’s flesh and drinking the Lord’s blood will lead to eternal life\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, at the last day I will raise him up. My flesh is food, and my blood is drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I abide in him. John 6:53-56\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) People who eat the bread of life will live forever\n<\/p>\nQuestion: If a person eats the bread of life, he will not die!<br \/>\nBelievers eat the Lord's Supper in the church and have eaten the Lord's bread of life. Why are their bodies dead?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: If a person eats the flesh of the Lord and drinks the blood of the Lord, he will have the life of Christ → This life is (1 born of water and the Spirit, 2 born of the true word of the gospel, 3 born of God), this “new man” life born of God Never see death! Amen. Note: We will explain in detail when we share \"Rebirth\" in the future!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(For example) Jesus said to \"Martha\":\"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, even though he dies, yet will he live; whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" ” John 11:25-26\n<\/p>\nThe flesh, which came from the \"dust\" of our ancestor Adam and was \"born of our parents, was sold to sin, which perishes and sees death. All men are mortal once.\" Reference Hebrews 9:27<br \/>\n<p>\n\tOnly those who have been resurrected by God, who have been resurrected with Christ, who eat the flesh of the Lord and drink the blood of the Lord, have the life of Christ. This life is: the \"new man\" born of God has eternal life and will never see death! God will also raise us up at the last day, that is, the redemption of our bodies. Amen!

Go. John 14:5-6\n<\/p>\nQuestion: The Lord is the way! What kind of road is this?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1. The way of the cross\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"Door\" Door! If we want to find this road, we must first know who \"opens the door\" for us so that we can see this road to eternal life.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) Jesus is the door! open the door for us\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(The Lord said) I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. John 10:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Let us see the way to eternal life\n<\/p>\nAnyone who wants to gain eternal life must go through the way of the cross of Jesus!<br \/>\n(Jesus) then called the crowd together with his disciples and said to them, “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tFor whoever wants to save his soul will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and the gospel will save it. Mark 8:34-35\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Be saved and gain eternal life\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How can I save my life?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: \"The Lord says\" Lose your life first.\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How to lose your life?<br \/>\nAnswer: Take up your cross and follow Jesus, \"believe\" in the gospel of the Lord Jesus, be baptized into Christ, be crucified with Christ, destroy your body of sin, and lose your \"old man\" life from Adam; believe in and If Christ died, was buried, resurrected, reborn, and saved, you will have the \"new\" life that was resurrected from the last Adam [Jesus]. This is a life that will be saved! Reference Romans 6:6-8<br \/>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Jesus said: \"My way\" → this way is the way of the cross. If people in the world don’t believe in Jesus, they won’t understand that this is a way to eternal life, a spiritual way, and a way to save their own lives. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Jesus is the truth\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is truth?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: \"Truth\" is eternal.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(1) God is truth\n<\/p>\nJohn 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br \/>\nJohn 17:17 Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.<br \/>\n<p>\n\t\"Tao\" is → God, your \"Tao\" is the truth, therefore, God is the truth!

So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) Jesus is the truth\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the beginning, there was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; God’s Word is the truth → God is the truth, and Jesus is a man and God. Therefore, the Lord Jesus is the truth, and the words He speaks are spirit, life, and truth! Amen. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) The Holy Spirit is truth\n<\/p>\nThis is Jesus Christ who came by water and blood; not by water alone, but by water and blood, and bearing the witness of the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit is truth. 1 John 5:6-7<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3. Jesus is life\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is life?<br \/>\nAnswer: Jesus is life!<br \/>\nIn (Jesus) is life, and this life is the light of men. John 1:4<br \/>\nThis testimony is that God has given us eternal life; and this eternal life is in His Son (Jesus). If a person has the Son of God (Jesus), he has life; if he does not have the Son of God, he does not have life. So, do you understand? 1 John 5:11-12<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Does our physical Adam life have eternal life?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Adam’s life does not have eternal life because Adam sinned and was sold to sin. When we were in the flesh, we were also sold to sin. The wages of “sin” is death. Our physical life is made of dust and comes from Adam. Those who come from the body of sin, the flesh is dust and will return to dust, so it cannot inherit eternal life, and the corruptible cannot inherit the incorruptible. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSee Romans 7:14 and Genesis 3:19\n<\/p>\nQuestion: How do we obtain eternal life?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Believe in Jesus, believe in the gospel, understand the true way, and receive the promised Holy Spirit as a seal!

The Lord Jesus opens the door for us. Let us see that this way of the cross is the way of eternal life. God! You have opened a new and living way for us to pass through the veil. This veil is His (Jesus) body, allowing us to enter the Holy of Holies with confidence, which is to enter the kingdom of heaven and eternal life!

What you bear is the Son of God\n<\/p>\nThe angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary! You have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you can name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; the Lord God will make him great. Give him the throne of guard. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end.<br \/>\n<p>\n\tMary said to the angel, \"I am not married. How can this happen?\" The angel answered and said, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.\" (Or translation: He who is to be born will be called holy, and will be called the Son of God).

So he knows that Jesus is the Son of God. So, do you understand? Refer to Revelation 12:4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(4) Jesus himself said that he was the Son of God\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said you are gods?'

This Word was with God in the beginning. …The Word became flesh (that is, God became flesh) and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth. And we have beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father. John 1:1-2,14<br \/>\n<p>\n\tNo one has ever seen God, only the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father has revealed Him. John 1:18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) Show the light of human life\n<\/p>\nIn Him (Jesus) is life, and this life is the light of men. John 1:4<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo Jesus said to the people again, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\" John 8:12\n<\/p>\n[Note:] \"Darkness\" refers to Hades, hell; if you follow Jesus, the true light, you will no longer go into the darkness of Hades.<br \/>\nIf your eyes are dim (cannot see the true light), your whole body will be in darkness. If the light within you is darkened (without the light of Jesus), how great is the darkness! ” Right? Matthew 6:23<br \/>\nGenesis 1:3 God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. This “light” means that Jesus is the light, the light of human life! With this light of life, God created the heavens and the earth and all things. On the fourth day, he created the lights and stars in the sky and arranged them in the sky. On the sixth day, God created male and female according to his own image. He worked for six days and rested on the seventh day. . Refer to Genesis Chapters 1-2<br \/>\n<p>\n\tSo, John said! God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. This is the message we have heard from the Lord and brought back to you. 1 John 1:5 Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(4) Show the way of life\n<\/p>\nConcerning the original word of life from the beginning, this is what we have heard, seen, seen with our own eyes, and touched with our hands. 1 John 1:1<br \/>\n“In the beginning” means “at the beginning of Jehovah’s creation,<br \/>\nIn the beginning, before all things were created,<br \/>\nThere is me (referring to Jesus).<br \/>\nFrom eternity, from the beginning,<br \/>\nBefore the world was, I was established.<br \/>\nThere is no abyss, no fountain of great water, from which I was born. Proverbs 8:22-24<br \/>\n<p>\n\tJohn said!

Mary became pregnant by the Holy Spirit\n<\/p>\nThe birth of Jesus Christ is recorded as follows: His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they were married, Mary became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Matthew 1:18<br \/>\nIn the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee (named Nazareth) to a virgin betrothed to a man of the house of David, whose name was John. Se. The virgin’s name was Mary;…the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary! You have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you can name him Jesus.…Mary said to the angel, “I have not Getting married, why is this happening? The angel replied, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who is to be born will be called the Son of God.\" ). Luke 1:26-27,30-31,34-35<br \/>\nThese two verses say! The Holy Spirit came to Mary, and Mary became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and was born from the virgin. Amen!<br \/>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: What is the difference between Jesus' \"birth\" and our \"birth\"?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t【The virgin conceived by the Holy Spirit】\n<\/p>\nQuestion: What is a virgin?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: We humans experience birth → \"girls\" are called → young girls (babies) when they are born from the mother's womb; after the age of young girls, they become → virgins; after the age of virgins, they become → girls; after the girls get married in Huaichun, they become → women; after the age of women, Just middle-aged women; when they get older, they are called wives or grandmothers.\n<\/p>\nTherefore, \"virgin\" is the age before menstruation and before a girl ovulates and becomes pregnant. She is called a \"virgin\"! A \"girl\"'s body begins to ovulate due to physiological characteristics, and menstruation occurs after ovulation. The body's physiological need to ovulate is to want to get married. A girl is called a \"girl\" when she is pregnant, and a girl who marries a man and gives birth to a child is a \"woman\". So, do you understand?<br \/>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Jesus was conceived by the Virgin Mary and born from the Holy Spirit. Jesus came from heaven. Just like Abraham's wife Sarah, who was very old and had stopped menstruating. God also promised her to conceive and give birth to a son, Isaac. Isaac was the child God promised to give birth to, and Isaac typified Christ! Amen\n<\/p>\n→→What about us? It is born from the union of woman and man. It comes from the earth. It is created from the dust of Adam. It is the root of Adam's transgression and sin when he \"ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\". Do you understand this clearly? ?<br \/>\n<p>\n\t2. Name him Jesus\n<\/p>\nThe angel said to her, \"Don't be afraid, Mary! You have found favor with God. You are going to conceive and give birth to a son, and you can name him Jesus. Luke 1:30-31<br \/>\n<p>\n\tThe name Jesus means to save his people from their sins. Amen\n<\/p>\nShe will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. ” Matthew 1:21<br \/>\n<p>\n\t3. God’s words must be fulfilled\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAll these things took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel.” (Emmanuel means “God with us.”) in\".)

From this perspective, there must be another Sabbath rest remaining for God’s people. For he who enters rest has rested from his own works, just as God rested from his.

So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Note:<\/strong> The Seventh-day Adventists →taught them to be careful - things that bring death and damnation ( <span style=\"color:#993366;\"><strong>words<\/strong><\/span> ) law, which is a dead end and a curse.

The flesh has been sold to sin<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that the law is of the spirit, but I am of the flesh and have been sold to sin. Reference (Romans 7:14) → For example, Moses in Egypt was the son of Pharaoh’s children, and Egypt represents the world, the sinful world. When the Israelite Moses grew up, he knew that he was God’s chosen people, a holy chosen people. He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's children and enjoy the wealth of Egypt → including all the knowledge, learning, food, drink and pleasure of Egypt. He would rather suffer with God's people than temporarily enjoy the pleasures of sin. When he saw the suffering of the people, he saw the humiliation of Christ → He refused to be the son of Pharaoh's children and fled Egypt to the wilderness at the age of 40. After 40 years of tending sheep in Midian, he forgot his identity as a son and daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh, and forgot all the knowledge, learning and talents in Egypt. Only when he was 80 years old did God call him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Just as the Lord Jesus said: \"Truly I say to you, whoever is not like a child will not be able to enter the kingdom of God.\" Only God used Moses to turn back to the likeness of a child. The likeness of a child is weakness and does not rely on worldly knowledge and learning. and wisdom, relying solely on God’s wisdom. So, do you understand?<br \/>\nMoses is the son of Pharaoh's children, which typifies the flesh sold to sin, and the flesh enjoying the sinful Egyptian king's possessions and all the food, drink, play, and pleasures. The physical enjoyment of these pleasures → is called enjoying the pleasure of sin!<br \/>\nTherefore, Moses refused to be the son of Pharaoh's children, but was willing to suffer in the flesh with the people → because he who suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin. Reference (1 Peter Chapter 4:1), do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Those born of God are not of the flesh<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are no longer of the flesh but of the Spirit. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. Reference (Romans 8:9)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#3366ff;\"><strong>ask:<\/strong><\/span> Why do things born of God not belong to the flesh?<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>answer:<\/strong><\/span> The Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the Son of God are “one spirit” and that is the Holy Spirit! If the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, dwells in your hearts → that is, the Holy Spirit dwells in Christ (we are members of His body), Since you are the body of Christ, you are not of the \"Adamic\" flesh; your body of Christ is of the Holy Spirit! Amen. If Christ is in you, (the Adamic body does not belong to us) the body is dead because of sin. , but the spirit (the Holy Spirit) lives by righteousness. (Romans 8:10), do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. The pleasure of sin and the joy of enjoying God<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ask:<\/strong> How to distinguish the pleasure of sin from the joy of enjoying God?<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#339966;\"><strong>answer:<\/strong><\/span> Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(1) Pleasure in sin<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">1 The flesh has been sold to sin<\/span> --Refer to Romans 7:14<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">2 To be carnally minded is death<\/span> --Refer to Romans 8:6<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">3 Food is the belly, and the belly is food, but God will cause both to be destroyed.<\/span> --Refer to 1 Corinthians 6:13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Note:<\/strong> When we were in the flesh, we were already sold to sin → If you follow the flesh and have a mind set on the flesh, that is death, because the wages of sin is death. Food is the belly, and the belly of the flesh is for food → → You are considerate of the flesh, always eat well, drink well, play well, and enjoy the pleasures of the flesh → → enjoy the pleasure of sin! For example, when you work hard to make money, you always eat well for your body, dress well for your body, and buy a villa to live in well. If your body enjoys this kind of pleasure, you are enjoying the pleasure of sin. There are also games, idol dramas, sports, dancing, health care, beauty, travel... and more! It means that you [live] in Adam, in Adam's body, in Adam's [sinful] body → enjoy the joy and fun of [sinful body]. This is following the flesh and caring about the things of the flesh → the joy of sin. So, do you understand?<br \/>\nThe new man we are born of God is not of the flesh. Things about the body → <strong>As long as you have food and clothing, you should be content<\/strong> .

Reference (Romans 4:15)<br \/>\n<strong>2<\/strong> Where there is no law, there is no transgression → Because there is no law, transgressions are not considered transgressions, just as parents who see their children transgressing are not transgressions.<br \/>\n<strong>3<\/strong> New Testament Heavenly Father will not remember your transgressions → because there is no law! Your heavenly Father will not remember your transgressions; without the law he cannot condemn you → “This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will write my laws on their hearts, and I will put them in them.\" Then he said, \"I will remember their sins and their transgressions no more.\" Now that these sins have been forgiven, there is no need for any more sacrifices for sins.

Reference (Romans 3:20)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>It is the law to make people aware of their sins. The law is to reveal your sins. The law is to provoke wrath and make people suffer punishment.

Do you want the law?\" If you want the law → live in sin, go and get rid of \" <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">crime<\/span> \"If you live → you will die. Do you understand?\"<br \/>\nTherefore, if a child does not have the law, he has no transgression; if a child does not have the law, sin is not considered a sin; if a child does not have the law, he does not know sin, and the law cannot condemn a child.

(Hebrews 1:1-2)<br \/>\nBy faith we know that the worlds were created by the word of God; so that what is seen was not created out of the obvious.

God called the dry land \"earth\" and the gathering of water \"sea.\" God saw that it was good. God said, \"Let the earth bring forth grass, herbaceous plants bearing seed, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it, according to their kind.\" And it was so. (Genesis 1:9-11)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">4<\/span> On the fourth day God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate the day from the night, and to serve as signs for seasons, days, and years; let them be lights in the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was done. So God created two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the smaller light to rule the night. He also created the stars (Genesis 1:14-16)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">5<\/span> On the fifth day, God said, “Let the waters multiply with living things, and let birds fly above the earth and in the sky.” (Genesis 1:20)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">6<\/span> On the sixth day God said, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds; cattle, creeping things, and wild beasts, according to their kinds.\" And it happened. … God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds in the air, over the livestock on the earth, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. ” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created he; male and female he created he.

Then we will have no laws or ordinances against us → for where there is no law, there is none. There are transgressions; without the law, sin is not considered sin. Without laws and regulations, you cannot be convicted, so sin is not considered sin, because the new man born of God does not sin if he abides in Christ. As Paul said, even he does not sin.

Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But if it weren’t for the law, I wouldn’t know what sin is. Unless the law says, \"Thou shalt not be greedy,\" I would not know what greed is. However, sin took the opportunity to activate all kinds of covetousness in me through the commandment; for without the law, sin is dead. Before I was alive without the law; but when the commandment came, sin came to life again, and I died. Refer to Romans 7:7-9.

Returning to that cowardly and useless primary school, are you willing to be his slave again?

Since the law is useless and achieves nothing, Jesus \"blotted it out, removed it, and abolished it\" through death. Crucified. So, do you understand? →The former ordinance, being weak and useless, was done away with (the law had accomplished nothing), and a better hope was introduced, by which we can approach God.

Yes! So is “Jesus” the Almighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace? Jesus said to Philip!

Jesus Christ died for all, and all died, all are us, that we who died to sin might live for righteousness. Amen! Right? It is the replacement of “us” the righteous “Jesus” who are unrighteous → God made Him who knew no sin (sinless: the original text is to know no sin) to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

Refer to Romans 6:7 → It says here that “those who are dead are freed from sin.” My body is still alive! Do I have to wait until I die to be free from sin? No, for example, there once was a father whose son committed a sin and was sentenced to death according to the law! The father of the son hurriedly went to find all the statutes and offensive words in the law that condemned his son, and blotted out and removed them. Then the father was judged by the law for his son, became sin, and died for his son. From then on the son was freed from sin and from the judgment of the law. Now the son is a righteous man! Not sinners, sinners are under the law.

The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the face of the abyss; but the Spirit of God was upon the waters. God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. God called the light \"day\" and the darkness \"night.\" There is evening and there is morning. This is the first day.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#ffba12;\">(1) Jesus is the true light, the light of human life<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus then said to the crowds, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" - John 8:12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGod is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. This is the message we have heard from the Lord and brought back to you. --1 John 1:5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn him was life, and this life was the light of men. …That light is the true light, illuminating all who live in the world. --John 1:4,9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Note]: In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the face of the abyss; but the Spirit of God was upon the waters. God said: \"Let there be light\", and there was light → \"Light\" refers to life, the light of life → Jesus is the \"true light\" and \"life\" → He is the light of man's life, and life is in Him, and this life is man. The light of Jesus → Anyone who follows Jesus will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life → the \"life of Jesus\"! Amen. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo God created the heavens and the earth and all things → God said: “Let there be light”, and there was light. When God saw that the light was good, he separated the light from the darkness.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#ffba12;\">(2) You believe that Jesus is the Son of Light<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJohn 12:36 Believe in the light while you have it, that you may become children of light. ” When Jesus had said this, he left them and hid himself.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 Thessalonians 5:5 You are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night, nor of darkness.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. --1 Peter 2:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Note]: Jesus is \"light\" → we follow \"Jesus\" → we follow the light → we become children of light! Amen. → But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s people, that you may proclaim “the gospel” the virtues of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→Lord Jesus Christ salvation. → As the Lord Jesus said: \"I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me will never abide in darkness. Reference - John 12:46\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(3)Darkness<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe light shines in the darkness, but the darkness does not receive the light. --John 1:5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf anyone says he is in the light but hates his brother, he is still in darkness. He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, not knowing where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. --1 John 2:9-11\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLight has come into the world, and men love darkness instead of light because their deeds are evil. This is their condemnation. Everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be rebuked. --John 3:19-20\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>[Note]:<\/strong> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness does not receive the light → Jesus is the \"Light\". Not accepting \"Jesus\" → means not accepting \"light\". They are walking in \"darkness\" and don't know where they are going. →So the Lord Jesus said: \"Your eyes are the lamps on your body. If your eyes are clear →\" your spiritual eyes are opened → you see Jesus\", your whole body will be bright; if your eyes are dim and you \"have not seen Jesus\", your whole body will be dark. . Therefore, examine yourself, lest there be darkness in you. If there is light in your whole body, and no darkness at all, you will be completely bright, like the brightness of a lamp.” Do you understand this clearly?

Because when we were in the flesh, the evil desires that were born of the law were working in our members, producing the fruit of death.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen lust is conceived, it gives birth to sin; when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death. --James 1:15\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>[Note]:<\/strong> When we are in the flesh → \"have lusts\" → \"flesh lusts\" are evil desires → because → \"the law\" is activated in our members → \"desires are activated\" → the \"pregnancy\" begins, and as soon as the lusts become pregnant → they give birth. When sin comes, sin, when it has matured, gives birth to death, that is, it bears the fruit of death. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Where does \"sin\" come from?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnswer: \"Sin\" → when we are in the flesh → \"flesh lusts\" → because of the \"law\", \"the lusts set in motion\" in our members → \"the lusts set in motion\" → begin to \"pregnant\" → as the lusts become pregnant → they give birth to sin. \"Sin\" is \"born\" due to lust + law →. So, do you understand clearly? Where there is no law, there is no transgression; where there is no law, sin is not counted; where there is no law, sin is dead. See Romans chapter 4 verse 15, chapter 5 verse 13 and chapter 7 verse 8.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">(2) The power of sin is the law, and the sting of death is sin.<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDie! Where is your power to overcome?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDie! Where is your sting?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. --1 Corinthians 15:55-56. Note: The sting of death → is sin, the wages of sin → is death, and the power of sin → is the law. So, do you know the relationship between these three?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhere there is \"law\" there is → \"sin\", and when there is \"sin\" there is → \"death\". So the Bible says → where there is no law, there is no \"trespass\" → \"without transgression\" → no breaking of the law → no breaking of the law → no sin, \"without sin\" → no sting of death \". So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">(3) Freedom from the law and the curse of the law<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut since we died to the law that bound us, we are now \"freed from the law\" so that we can serve the Lord according to the newness of spirit (spirit: or translated as the Holy Spirit) and not according to the old ritual Sample. --Romans 7:6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGalatians 2:19 For through the law I died to the law, that I might live to God. → You also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to others, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God. --Romans 7:4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming the curse for us; for it is written, \"Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.\" -- Galatians Book 3:13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Note]: The apostle \"Paul\" said: \"I died to the law because of the law → 1 \"I died to the law\" through the body of Christ → 2 \"I died to the law\" → 3 in the law that bound me Dead.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">ask:<\/span><\/strong> What is the \"purpose\" of dying to the law?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><span style=\"color:#339966;\">answer:<\/span><\/strong> Free from the law and its curse.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe apostle \"Paul\" said → I was crucified and died with Christ → <span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">1<\/span> free from sin, <span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">2<\/span> \"Freed from the law and the curse of the law.\" Do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>So there is only:<\/strong> <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">1<\/span> Being free from the law → being free from sin; <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">2<\/span> Being free from sin → is free from the power of the law; <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">3<\/span> Being freed from the power of the law → freed from the judgment of the law; <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">4<\/span> Being freed from the judgment of the law → freed from the sting of death.

Let everyone in the world fall under the judgment of God. Refer to Romans 3:19-20. If you keep the law of Moses but fail to do so, you will be condemned by the law. You will be condemned by Moses, because Moses is the steward of the law. Do you understand? Therefore, the ministry of the law is the ministry of condemnation.

And turn to [Matthew 26:28] For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. Turn back to [Hebrews 9:15] For this reason He has become the mediator of the new covenant, so that those who are called may receive it by dying atonement for their sins committed under the first covenant. Promised eternal inheritance.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230429064434584.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">(2) The Old Testament is the first covenant<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Note: By studying the above scripture records, the Lord Jesus established the \"New Covenant\" with us. Since it is said to be a new covenant, there will be an \"Old Covenant\", which is the previous covenant. The \"Previous Covenant\" recorded in the Bible mainly includes: <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">1<\/span> God made a commandment with Adam in the Garden of Eden, \"the covenant not to eat from the tree of good and evil\", which was also a covenant of \"language\" law; <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">2<\/span> Noah's \"rainbow\" peace covenant after the great flood typified the new covenant; <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">3<\/span> The \"promise\" covenant of Abraham's faith typifies the covenant of God's grace; <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">4<\/span> The Mosaic Law Covenant was a clearly stated law covenant with the Israelites. Refer to Deuteronomy 5 verses 1-3.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">(3) Sin entered the world from Adam alone<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAdam, the first ancestor, broke the law and sinned and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil! Just as through one man sin entered the world, and through sin death came to all men, because all have sinned. However, from Adam to Moses, death reigned, and even those who did not sin like Adam were under his dominion - \"That is, even those who did not sin like Adam are like us who are also dead Under the authority\". Refer to Romans 5:12-14; the wages of sin is death – refer to Romans 6:23; the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law – refer to 1 Corinthians 15:56; the first ancestor Adam If a person violates a contract and commits a crime, he becomes a \"Slaves of sin\", all descendants born from the ancestor Adam are slaves of \"sin\", because the power of sin is the law, the descendants of Adam are under the law \"You shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" Following the law of commandments. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">(4) The relationship between law, sin and death<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJust as \"sin\" reigns, it will be cursed by the law, which leads to death - refer to Romans 5:21 → Likewise, grace also reigns through \"righteousness\", causing people to gain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ eternal life. Amen! In this way, we know that \"death\" comes from \"sin\" - \"sin\" comes from one man, Adam, who broke the covenant of the law. Breaking the law is \"sin\" - refer to John 1 Chapter 3 verse 3. ［ <span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">law<\/span> ]--[ <span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">crime<\/span> ]--[ <span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">die<\/span> ] The three are interrelated. If you want to escape from \"death\", you must escape from \"sin\". If you want to escape from \"sin\", you must escape from the law, which means that you must escape from the curse that will judge you. Cursed is your covenant of law. So, do you understand clearly? Therefore, the \"first covenant\" is the law of Adam's covenant \"not to eat from the tree of good and evil\". We must rely on the Lord Jesus Christ to escape from it. \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world (or translate: to judge the world; The same below), so that the world will be saved through him. Whoever believes in him will not be condemned; whoever does not believe is already condemned because he has not believed in the name of God’s only begotten Son - refer to John 3 verses 16-18.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">(5) The former covenant is released through the suffering death of Christ<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGod sent his only begotten Son, Jesus, to become flesh and be born under the law to redeem those under the law so that we can obtain the title of sons of God!

Let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 9 verses 15-17. For this reason, \"Jesus\" has become the mediator of the new covenant. Since he died and was \"crucified for our sins\" to atone for the sins committed by people during the \"previous covenant\", he will enable the called ones to gain God.

Since the priesthood had been changed, the law must also be changed. Verse 16 He became a priest, not according to the ordinances of the flesh, but according to the power of infinite (literally, indestructible) life. Verse 18 The former ordinance was done away with because it was weak and unprofitable. Verse 19 (the law accomplished nothing) introduces a better hope by which we can approach God.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(Note:<\/strong> The Old Testament is the first covenant, <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">1<\/span> The covenant in the Garden of Eden that Adam must not eat from the \"Tree of Good and Evil\"; <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">2<\/span> Noah's \"rainbow\" covenant of peace typifies the new covenant; <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">3<\/span> Abraham's faith in the \"covenant of promise\" is a covenant of grace; <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">4<\/span> Mosaic Law Covenant.

Jesus became a priest, not according to the ordinances of the flesh, but according to the power of infinite life. The previous ordinances were abolished because they were weak and useless.

The law originally appointed weak people as priests. But after the law, God swore to appoint his son Jesus as the high priest.

Therefore, the first covenant-the covenant of the law will soon disappear. See Hebrews 10:1 and Col. 2:16. So, do you understand clearly?

I came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it.

Since you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your (original text: our) hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!” You can see that from now on, you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, you rely on God is his heir.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428213835669.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> By examining the above scriptures, we record that you must not owe anyone anything except loving one another.

The love of the world is all false, as it is written, There is no righteous, not even one, because everyone has broken the law, and breaking the law is sin, and everyone in the world has sinned and fallen short of God. glory! Since the law is weak because of the human flesh, it cannot fulfill the righteousness of the law. Now, by God's grace, God sent His own Son, Jesus, to become flesh, and was born under the law, taking on the likeness of sinful flesh, becoming a sin offering, condemning our sins in the flesh, and being nailed to the cross. He died to free us from sin, the law, and the curse of the law. It is to redeem those who are under the law so that we can receive the title of sons of God.

In other words, the great love of Jesus has fulfilled the requirements and righteousness of the commandments, statutes, regulations and behavioral norms recorded in the book of the law for us, so that in Christ Jesus, we are no longer condemned by the law.

Abraham believed in the God who raises the dead and brings things into being from nothing, and who is the Father of us men before the Lord.

The world is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled with violence. God looked at the world and saw that it was corrupt; all flesh had corrupt practices on earth. Then God said to Noah, \"The end of all flesh has come before me; for the earth is filled with their violence, and I will destroy them and the earth together. You shall build an ark of gopher wood.\" , build them in chambers, and anoint them with rosin on the inside and on the outside.

There was no rain on the ground, and no one was plowing the land, but mist rose from the ground and moistened the land. The LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living soul, and his name was Adam. Genesis 1:26-30 God said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds in the air and over the livestock on the earth and over all the earth and everything on it. “And God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created he; male and female he created he. God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds in the air, and over every living creature that moves on the earth.” God said, “ Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing herb that is on the face of the earth, and every tree with its seed-bearing fruit for food. Give them green grass for food.” And it was so.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGenesis 2:18-24 The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper.\" The LORD God formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the air and brought them to the man. , see what his name is. Whatever the man calls each living creature, that is its name. The man named all the cattle, the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field; but the man found no mate to help him. The LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs and closed the flesh again. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man formed a woman and brought her to the man. The man said, \"This is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. You can call her woman, because she was taken from man.\" Therefore, a man will leave his parents and cleave to his wife. , the two become one.

The Lord God commanded him: \"You may freely eat from any tree of the garden, but you shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day you eat from it you will surely die!\" (Note: The serpent tempted Eve. Adam broke the law and sinned by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result, sin entered the world through Adam alone, and death came from sin. Then death came to everyone because everyone sinned without the law. , sin was already in the world; but without the law, sin was not considered sin. However, from Adam to Moses, death reigned, even those who did not sin with Adam were \"under the law.\" Under the dominion, under the dominion of sin, under the dominion of death.\" Adam is a type of the man who was to come, namely Jesus Christ.)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428144710799.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>2<\/strong> ) <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">Mosaic Law<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet’s study the Bible [Deuteronomy 5:1-3] and read it together: Then Moses called all the Israelites together and said to them, “O children of Israel, listen to the statutes and regulations that I am telling you today; Learn and keep it. The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. This covenant was not made with our ancestors, but with us who are here alive today.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> The covenant between Jehovah God and the Israelites includes: the Ten Commandments engraved on stone tablets, and a total of 613 statutes and regulations. It is a covenant that clearly stipulates the law. If you keep and obey all the commandments of the law, you will be blessed. \"You will be blessed when you go out, and you will be blessed when you come in.\" -Refer to Deuteronomy 28, verses 1-6 and 15-68)<br \/>\nLet’s study the Bible [Galatians 3:10-11] and read it together: Everyone who is based on the works of the law is under a curse; for it is written: “Whoever does not continue according to the book of the Law \"Cursed is anyone who does all the things that are written in it.\" It is evident that no one is justified before God by the law; for the Scripture says, \"The righteous shall live by faith.\"<br \/>\nTurn back to [Romans 5-6] and read together: For while we were in the flesh, the evil desires that were born of the law were working in our members, producing the fruit of death. But since we died to the law that bound us, we are now free from the law, so that we may serve the Lord according to the newness of spirit (spirit: or translated as the Holy Spirit) and not according to the old way of ritual.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> By examining the above scriptures, we can see that through the apostle [Paul] who was most proficient in Jewish law, God revealed the \"spirit\" of the law's righteousness, statutes, regulations and great love: Anyone who is based on the practice of the law, are all under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is anyone who does not continue in accordance with everything written in the book of the Law.” No one is justified before God by the law. This is obvious. Because when we were in the flesh, the evil desires that were born of the law, \"evil desires\" are lusts. When lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; when sin becomes full-grown, it gives birth to death - refer to James 1 chapter 15 Festival.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou can see clearly how [sin] is born: \"Sin\" is due to the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the flesh \"the evil desire that is born of the law\" begins in the members, and the lust begins in the members. When lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death. From this point of view, [sin] exists because of [the law]. Do you understand this clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">1<\/span> Where there is no law, there is no transgression - See Romans 4:15<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">2<\/span> Without the law, sin is not considered sin - See Romans 5:13<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">3<\/span> Without the law, sin is dead. Because if people who are created from the dust keep the law, they will give birth to sin because of the law. The more you keep it, the more sin you will give birth to. Therefore, it is obvious that no one can keep the law. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>1<\/strong> ) Just like \"Adam\" in the Garden of Eden because of a commandment \"not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\", Eve. Adam was tempted by the snake in Eden, and Eve's fleshly desires \"the evil that was born of the law\" She desires to work in their members, she wants fruit that is good for food, eyes that are bright and pleasing to the eye, knowledge of good and evil, things that are pleasing to the eye, that make people wise. In this way, they broke the law and sinned and were cursed by the law. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>2<\/strong> ) The Law of Moses is a covenant between Jehovah God and the Israelites at Mount Horeb, including a total of 613 ten commandments, statutes, and regulations. Israel did not keep the law, and all of them broke the law and sinned, and were subject to what was written in the Law of Moses. Curses and oaths, and all disasters were poured out on the Israelites - see Daniel 9:9-13 and Hebrews 10:28.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>3<\/strong> ) through the body of Christ who died to bind us to the law, we are now free from the law and its curse. Let’s study the Bible Romans 7:1-7 Brothers, I say now to those who understand the law, don’t you know that the law “rules” a person while he is alive? Because \"the power of sin is the law. As long as you live in Adam's body, you are a sinner. Under the law, the law controls you and restrains you. Do you understand?\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428144724730.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe apostle \"Paul\" uses [ <span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">The relationship between sin and law<\/span> ]simile[ <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">woman and husband relationship<\/span> ] Just like a woman who has a husband, she is bound by the law while the husband is alive; but if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of the husband. Therefore, if her husband is alive and she is married to someone else, she is called an adulteress; if her husband dies, she is freed from his law, and even if she is married to someone else, she is not an adulteress. <strong>Note:<\/strong> \"Women\", that is, we sinners, are bound by the \"husband\", that is, the law of marriage, while our husband is still alive. If you are not free from your husband's law of marriage, if you marry someone else, you are called an adulterer; our old self is \" The woman \"died\" to the law through the body of Christ on the cross, and was resurrected from the dead so that we can turn to others [Jesus] and bear spiritual fruit to God; if you have not \"died\" to the law, Even if you are not freed from the \"husband\" of the law and you marry to Jesus, you have committed adultery and you are called an adulteress [spiritual adulteress]. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo \"Paul\" said: Because of the law I died to the law, that I might live to God - refer to Gal. 2:19. But since we died to the law that bound us, we are now free from the law of the \"first covenant husband\", so that we can serve the Lord according to the newness of the spirit (spirit: or translated as the Holy Spirit) \"that is, born of God. The new man serving the Lord \"not according to the old ceremonial way\" means not according to the old way of sinners in the flesh of Adam. Do you all understand this clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThank you Lord! Today your eyes are blessed and your ears are blessed. God has sent workers to lead you to understand the truth of the Bible and the essence of the law of freedom from \"husbands\", as \"Paul\" said → <strong><span style=\"color:#339966;\">Through the Word in Christ with the Gospel<\/span><\/strong> \" <strong><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">born<\/span><\/strong> \"To give you to one husband, to present you as chaste virgins to Christ.

[Jesus]’s name means to save his people from their sins. He is the Savior, the Messiah, and the Christ! So, do you understand clearly? For example, the name \"UK\" refers to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which consists of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, referred to as \"UK\"; the name \"USA\" refers to the United States of America; the name \"Russia\" refers to Russia federal. The name \"Jesus\" means to save his people from their sins → this is what the name \"Jesus\" means. Do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThank you Lord!

The people were very agitated because of the difficulty of the road, and they complained to God and Moses, \"Why did you bring us out of Egypt (the land of slavery) and make us die (that is, starve to death) in the wilderness? (Because most of the wilderness of the Sinai Peninsula is desert), there is no food or water here, and our hearts hate this weak food (at that time, the Lord God dropped \"manna\" from heaven and gave it to the Israelites as food, but they still hated this food. meager food)” So the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit them. Many people died among the Israelites. (So God \"no longer protected\" them, and fiery serpents entered among the people, and they bitten them and were poisoned by the venom. Many people among the Israelites died.) The people came to Moses and said, \"We have sinned against the Lord and against you. \"Please pray to the LORD to take these snakes away from us.\" So Moses prayed for the people. The LORD said to Moses, \"Make a fiery serpent and put it on a pole. Whoever is bitten will look at the serpent and he will live.\" So Moses made a bronze serpent and put it on a pole. Anyone bitten by the snake will live. One look at the bronze snake and it came to life.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> \"Fire snake\" refers to a venomous snake; \"bronze snake\" refers to a non-venomous snake that looks like a snake but is not a snake. \"Bronze\" typifies light and sinlessness - refer to Revelation 2:18 and Romans 8:3. God made the shape of the \"brazen serpent\" which means \"non-venomous\" and means \"sinless\" to replace the \"sowing poison means sin\" that the Israelites hung on the pole to become a shame, curse and the death of snake poison.\" This is a type of Christ becoming our sin. The \"shape\" of the body was used as a sin offering. When the Israelites looked up at the \"brazen serpent\" hanging on the pole, the \"snake venom\" in their bodies transferred to the \"brazen serpent\" and destroyed them. Anyone bitten by a snake would live when he looked at the brazen serpent. Yes. The Israelites have received God’s healing and salvation.

Amen! For I, \"Paul,\" have determined not to know anything but among you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tKnowing Jesus Christ and Him crucified, the words I spoke and the sermons I preached were not in perverse words of wisdom, but in demonstrations of the Holy Spirit and of power, so that your faith may not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of God.

Amen. Today we will study, fellowship, and share the origin of the cross\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ancient roman cross<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#ff5e5e;\">crucifixion<\/span> , it is said that it was caused by <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">Phoenicians<\/span> Invention, the Phoenician Empire is the general name of a series of small city-states in the northern region of the east coast of the ancient Mediterranean. Its history can be traced back to the 30th century BC. The cross of the torture instrument usually consisted of two or three wooden stakes---or even four if it was a quadrilateral cross, with different shapes. Some are T-shaped, some are X-shaped, and some are Y-shaped. One of the great inventions of the Phoenicians was the execution of people by crucifixion. Later, <span style=\"color:#4b1785;\">This method was passed from the Phoenicians to the Greeks, Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians and Romans. Especially popular in the Persian Empire, Kingdom of Damascus,<\/span> <span style=\"color:#4b1785;\">judah<\/span> <span style=\"color:#4b1785;\">Kingdom, the Kingdom of Israel, Carthage, and ancient Rome, often used to execute rebels, heretics, slaves, and people without citizenship<\/span> .\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428143251711.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis cruel punishment originated from a wooden stake. At first, the prisoner was tied to a wooden stake and suffocated to death, which was both simple and cruel. Later wooden frames were introduced, including crosses, T-shaped frames and X-shaped frames. The X-shaped frame is also called \"Saint Andrew's frame\" because the saint died on the X-shaped frame.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough the details of executions vary slightly from place to place, the general situation is the same: the prisoner is whipped first and then forced to carry a wooden frame to the execution ground. Sometimes the wooden frame is so heavy that it is difficult for one person to move it. Before execution, the prisoner was stripped of his clothes, leaving only a loincloth. There is a wedge-shaped piece of wood under the prisoner's palms and feet to prevent the body from sliding down due to gravity. Then insert the cross into the prepared fixed opening on the ground. To hasten death, the limbs of the prisoner were sometimes broken. The stronger the prisoner's tolerance, the longer the torture. The merciless scorching sun burned their bare skin, flies bitten them and sucked their sweat, and the dust in the air suffocated them.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCrucifixion was usually carried out in batches, so several crosses were often erected at the same location. After the criminal was executed, he continued to hang on the cross for public display. After the public display, it was customary to bury the cross and the criminal together. The crucifixion later underwent some improvements, such as fixing the prisoner head down on a wooden frame, which could make the prisoner lose consciousness quickly and actually reduce the prisoner's pain.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428143304987.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt is difficult for modern people to imagine the pain of crucifixion, because on the surface, just tying a person to a stake does not seem to be a particularly cruel punishment. The prisoner on the cross did not die of hunger or thirst, nor did he die of bleeding—the nails were driven into the cross, the prisoner eventually died of suffocation. The crucified man could only breathe by stretching his arms. However, in such a posture, coupled with the intense pain caused by driving the nails in, all the muscles will soon produce a violent back contraction force, so the air filled in the chest cannot be discharged. To speed up suffocation, weights are often hung on the feet of the strongest people, so that they can no longer stretch their arms to breathe. The consensus among scientists is that crucifixion was an unusually cruel method of execution because it slowly tortured a person to death over a period of several days.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe earliest crucifixion in Rome should be during the reign of Targan at the end of the Seven Kings. Rome finally suppressed three slave rebellions. And every victory was accompanied by bloody massacres, and thousands of people were crucified. The first two were in Sicily, one in the first and a half centuries BC and the other in the first century BC. The third and most famous one, in 73 BC, was led by Spartacus and six thousand people were crucified. Crosses were erected all the way from Cabo to Rome. Execution by cross or column was very popular in Roman times, but began to slowly disappear in the centuries after Christ was crucified, rose from the dead and ascended to heaven. Those in power no longer used the method of executing \"sons of God\" to execute criminals, and hangings and other punishments began to be widely used.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428143324189.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\troman emperor <span style=\"color:#599aff;\">Constantine<\/span> exist <span style=\"color:#599aff;\">4th century AD<\/span> \"Discipline promulgated\" <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">Edict of Milan<\/span> \" <span style=\"color:#f04142;\">abolish<\/span> Crucifixion. <span style=\"color:#ffba12;\">cross<\/span> It is a symbol of today's Christianity, representing God's great love and redemption for the world. <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">431<\/span> Beginning to appear in the Christian church in AD <span style=\"color:#1a74ff;\">586<\/span> It was erected on the top of the church starting in the year.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOK!

Amen. So, do you understand clearly? See Mark 8:34-35.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBrothers and sisters! In the Garden of Eden God created Adam's \"spirit\" as a natural spirit. Now God is leading you into all the truth by sending workers → Understand that if you \"lose\" the soul of Adam → you will gain the soul of \"Christ\", that is, save your soul! You make your own choice → Do you want Adam’s soul? How about the soul of Christ? Just like → <strong>1<\/strong> The tree of good and evil, the \"bad tree\", was separated from the tree of life, the \"good tree\"; <strong>2<\/strong> The Old Covenant and the New Covenant are separate\", just like two contracts\"; <strong>3<\/strong> The covenant of law is separate from the covenant of grace;<em>4<\/em> The goats are separated from the sheep; <strong>5<\/strong> The earthly is separated from the heavenly; <strong>6<\/strong> Adam is separated from the last Adam; <strong>7<\/strong> The old man is separated from the new man → <span style=\"color:#eb28bd;\">[Old man]<\/span> The outer body gradually deteriorates due to selfish desires and returns to dust; <span style=\"color:#ffba12;\">[Newcomer]<\/span> Through the renewal of the Holy Spirit, we grow into adults day by day, full of the stature of the fullness of Christ, building ourselves up together with Christ in love.

In this way, you will \"no longer\" confess your sins every day for the sins of the old man's flesh, and pray for the precious blood of Jesus to cleanse and blot out your sins.

Born from God\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: What is the birth of blood, the birth of passion, and the birth of human will?<br \/>\nAnswer: The first man, Adam, became a living person with spirit (\"spirit\" or \"flesh\") - 1 Corinthians 15:45.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living soul, and his name was Adam. Genesis 2:7\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Note:] Adam, who was created from dust, became a living person with spirit, \"that is, a living person of flesh and blood.\" A living person of flesh and blood → has a body of flesh and blood, has evil passions and desires, and God calls Adam \"man\"; therefore, all people from Adam Everything that comes out of the roots → is born of blood, passion, and human will! Do you understand this?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: What is born of God?<br \/>\nAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God - John 1:1<br \/>\n\"The Word\" became flesh → that is, \"God\" became flesh, and \"God\" is a spirit → that is, \"Spirit\" became flesh. He was conceived by a virgin from the Holy Spirit and was born, named Jesus! Refer to Matthew 1:21, John 1:14, 4:24\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus was born of the Heavenly Father → Of all the angels, to which one did God ever say: You are my Son, and I have begotten you today? Which of them did he say: I will be his Father, and he will be my son? Hebrews 1:5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How do we receive Jesus?<br \/>\nAnswer: We believe that Jesus is the Son of God. If we eat his body and drink the blood of the Lord, we will have the \"life of Jesus Christ\" within us! Reference John 6:53-56\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Father Jehovah is God, the Son Jesus is God, and the Holy Spirit the Comforter is also God! When we welcome Jesus, we welcome God. When we welcome the one sent by God, we welcome the Holy Father! To receive the promised Holy Spirit is to have Jesus. If you have the Son \"Jesus\", you have the Father. Amen! Reference 1 John 2:23\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, everyone who receives the promised Holy Spirit, receives Jesus, and receives the Holy Father! A \"new man\" is reborn within you → This kind of man is not born of \"Adam's\" blood, not of lust, nor of human will, but of God.<br \/>\nSo, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. Born from God (not belonging to) Adam’s body\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet’s study the Bible Romans 8:9 If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are not of the flesh but of the Spirit. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: \"The Spirit of God\" → is the Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of the Father, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit of truth! It is also called the Comforter and the Anointing.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit dwells in you! A \"person\" is born again in you - see Romans 7:22. This \"man\" is the body of Jesus, the blood of Jesus, the life of Christ, a spiritual person. This \"new man\" is the body of Christ! Amen\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou \"new man\" do not belong to the \"old man\" Adam's physical body, the \"new man\"'s immortal spiritual body; you do not belong to the \"old man\" Adam's corruptible body. Your regenerated \"new man\" belongs to the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God the Father! Amen\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf Christ is in you, the \"old man\" in the body dies because of sin → died with Christ; but the soul is justified and lives by \"faith\" → the \"new man\" lives with Christ! So, do you understand? Reference Romans 8:9-10\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428135059708.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3. Anyone born of God will never sin\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet’s turn to 1 John 3:9 Whoever is born of God does not sin, because the word of God abides in him; nor can he sin, because he is born of God.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why do those who are born of God never sin?<br \/>\nAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 For the word of God abides in the heart - John 3:9<br \/>\n2 But the Spirit of God dwells in you, and you are not carnal - Romans 8:9<br \/>\n3 The new man born of God abides in Jesus Christ - 1 John 3:6<br \/>\n4 The law of the Spirit of life has made me free from the law of sin and death - Romans 8:2<br \/>\n5 Where there is no law, there is no transgression - Romans 4:15<br \/>\n6 Washed, sanctified, justified by the Spirit of God - 1 Corinthians 6:11<br \/>\n7 Old things have passed away; all things have become new - 2 Corinthians 5:17\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe \"old man\" was crucified with Christ → old things have passed away;\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe \"new man\" lives with Christ, now abides in Christ, has been cleansed, sanctified, and justified through the Holy Spirit → everything has become new (called a new man)!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Can Christians (new ones) sin?<br \/>\nAnswer: No one who is born of God will sin; whoever sins is of the devil. Reference 1 John 3:8-10, 5:18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Some preachers say that Christians still commit sins. What is going on?<br \/>\nAnswer: People who say that they (born of God) can sin do not understand the salvation of Christ. They are deceived by error. Because those who sin are not regenerated; those who are not regenerated do not have the promised Holy Spirit! Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(If Christ is in you:)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 The \"old man\" body is dead because of sin → He who \"believes\" that the old man is dead is free from sin - Romans 6:6-7<br \/>\n2 Freed from the law → Where there is no law, there there is no transgression - Romans 4:15<br \/>\n3 Put off the old man and its deeds → If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are no longer in the flesh (the old deeds) - Romans 8:9, Col 3:9<br \/>\n4 Without the law, sin is not counted → \"New Testament\" God will no longer remember your sins and transgressions. The transgressions of the old man's fleshly behavior were crucified with Christ because you have died (refer to Col. 3:3 )So God does not remember! - Romans 5:13, Hebrews 10:16-18<br \/>\n5 For without the law sin is dead (Romans 7:8) → You have been put away from sin, from the law, and from the old man and his works through the body of Christ. You have died - Col. 3:3. Your regenerated \"new man\" does not belong to the deeds and transgressions of the old man's flesh. God will no longer remember your sins and transgressions, so Paul said! Consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus - Romans 6:11<br \/>\n6 The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness (Romans 8:10)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How does the body of sin die?<br \/>\nAnswer: Believe in dying with Christ → experience the death of the old man and gradually put it off → take on a dead body, a mortal body, a corruptible body, and the outer body will gradually destroy and become corrupted (Ephesians 4:21-22) Adam’s sinful body It is from dust and to dust it will return. --Refer to Genesis 3:19\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How do newcomers live?<br \/>\nAnswer: Live with Christ → The new man (reborn spiritual man) abides in Christ Jesus, and in you (the new man) is growing day by day into a man, growing into the stature of Christ. If a \"treasure\" is placed in an earthen vessel, it will show that this great power comes from God. It activates the death of Jesus and also shows the life of Jesus → preaching the gospel, preaching the truth, and leading many people to righteousness! Experience resurrection with Christ and the redemption of the body. The spiritual life of the \"new man\" will achieve an incomparable weight of eternal glory. When Christ appears, your body will also appear (that is, the body is redeemed), and you will be resurrected even more beautifully! Amen. Reference 2 Corinthians 4:7-18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t7 Whoever is born of God does not sin, because the word of God abides in him; nor can he sin, because he is born of God. 1 John 3:9 , 5:18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOK! Today we are sharing \"Rebirth\" here.<br \/>\nLet us pray to God together: Dear Abba Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, thank you that the Holy Spirit is always with us! Constantly illuminate our spiritual eyes and open our minds so that we can see and hear spiritual truths, understand the Bible, and understand rebirth, 1 born of water and the Spirit, 2 born of the true word of the gospel, 3 born of God! He who abides in Jesus Christ is holy, sinless, and does not sin. No one who is born of God will sin, for we are all born of God. Amen<br \/>\nIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

Reference - 1 Peter Chapter 2 Verse 22 → Since we have a high priest who has ascended to heaven, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. Because our high priest is not unable to sympathize with our weaknesses. He was in every point tempted as we are, yet without sin. Reference - Hebrews 4 verses 14-15. Note: The original meaning of \"sinless\" by God is \"knowing no sin\", just like a child who does not know good and evil. Jesus is the incarnate Word → is holy, sinless, flawless, and undefiled! There is no law of good and evil → Where there is no law, there is no transgression! So he did not sin, because God's Word was in his heart, and he could not sin!

Just as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience many were made righteous. → So were some of you; but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

Because of the disobedience of one Adam, all were made sin; so because of the obedience of one, Jesus, all are made righteous.

The kings of the earth have committed adultery with her, and those who live on the earth have become drunk with the wine of her fornication.”… On her forehead is a name written: “Mystery, Babylon the Great, the whore of the earth.” \"Mother of abominations.\" And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly amazed. Note: The church in which the king of the earth and the church are unified → is a \"mystery\"! On the outside is the \"Christian Church\", and you can't tell the truth from the false. It's called a \"mystery\" → But inside, the kings of the earth are committing adultery with \"her\", the church, colluding with each other, using worldly principles and human philosophy, and they don't follow them.

On the outside, she wears the name of the church of \"Christ\", but on the inside she commits adultery with the king, shouting \"Jesus\" in her mouth, but in fact her head and authority are the king. . In most churches in the world, many people are drunk with the wine of her fornication, which is the world's Neo-Confucianism and the misleading fallacies. This means that the church has combined the world's philosophies, Neo-Confucianism, such as Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism and others.

Only then can we inherit the kingdom of God, inherit eternal life, and inherit the inheritance of our Heavenly Father. Therefore, you must know that those who are based on \"faith\" are the descendants of Abraham. --Refer to Galatians chapter 3 verse 7. What I am saying is that God's covenant in advance refers to God's promise that Abraham and his descendants will inherit the \"kingdom of God\" in the world. --Refer to Genesis 22:16-18 and Romans 4:13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#0e408c;\">(3) God’s promises cannot be nullified by the law<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt cannot be abolished by the law 430 years later. →_→ refers to the \"law of Moses\". According to the \"righteousness\" in the law, no one who keeps the law has violated the law and violated the law. crime. Because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; – refer to chapter 3 verse 23. According to the law →_→ everyone in the world has committed \"sin\", and the work of \"sin\" is \"death\". That is to say, when people die and return to dust, then wouldn’t the blessings promised by God in advance become in vain?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the covenant established by God in advance cannot be annulled by the law four hundred and thirty years later, making the promise void. Because if the inheritance is \"by the law, it is not by the promise\"; but God gave the inheritance to Abraham based on the promise. →_→If only those who belong to the law are heirs, \"faith\" will be in vain and \"promise\" will be nullified.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428080631578.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#0e408c;\">(4) The law arouses anger and punishes people<\/span> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor the law provokes wrath (or translation: calls for punishment); where there is no law, there is no transgression. →_→ refers to our redemption through Jesus Christ, which makes us → 1 free from sin → 2 free from the law → 3 free from the old man Adam → 4 moved us from the \"new man\" born of God to the kingdom of the beloved Son.

So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Alert:<\/strong> Anyone who is based on the works of the law is cursed, because no one can be justified before God by the works of the law. It is by the \"law\" and not by \"faith\", but by the works of the law. Law-based people are alienated from Christ and have fallen from grace. The blessings promised by God were made void by them. Therefore, the blessings promised by God are based on \"faith\"; not based on \"law\"! Amen.

He deserves it; but to the one who does no works but believes in God who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness. Just as David calls those who are justified by God apart from their works blessed. Romans 9:11 For the twins were not yet born, and no good or evil was done, but that God's purpose in election might be revealed, not because of works, but because of Him who calls them. )\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(2) Grace is given freely<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[Matthew 5:45] In this way you may become sons of your Father who is in heaven, for He makes his sun rise on the good and the evil, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unjust. Psalm 65:11 You crown your years with grace; all your paths drip with fat. (Note: Isn’t the sun, rain, dew, air, etc. also God’s grace, freely given to mankind?)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(3) Christ’s salvation depends on faith; it does not depend on obedience to the law<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet us search the Bible [Romans 3:21-28] and read together: But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from the law, having the testimony of the law and the prophets: even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ To everyone who believes, without distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; but are now justified freely by God’s grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God established Jesus as the propitiation by virtue of the blood of Jesus and through man’s faith to demonstrate God’s righteousness; because He patiently tolerated the sins committed by people in the past in order to demonstrate His righteousness in the present time. that he himself may be known to be righteous, and that he may also justify those who believe in Jesus. If this is the case, how can you boast? There is nothing to boast about. How can we use something that is not available? Is it a meritorious method? No, it is the method of believing in the Lord. So (there are ancient scrolls: because) we are certain: <span style=\"color:#E56600;\">A person is justified by faith, not by obedience to the law<\/span> .\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> Both the Jews who were under the Mosaic law and the Gentiles who were without the law are now justified by God’s grace and are freely justified through faith in the salvation of Jesus Christ! Amen, it is not a method of meritorious service, but a method of believing in the Lord.

In terms of the righteousness in the law, Paul said that he kept the law and was blameless. Why did Jesus say that none of them kept the law? This is because they kept the law, but no one kept the law. They all broke the law. Breaking the law is sin, so they all sinned. This is why Jesus rebuked the Jews for not keeping the Law of Moses. <strong>Paul himself said that previously keeping the law was beneficial, but now that he has come to know the salvation of Christ, keeping the law is detrimental.<\/strong> --Refer to Philippians 3:6-8.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Paul understood the salvation of God's grace through Christ, he also rebuked the circumcised Jews for not keeping the law even themselves - Galatians 6:13.

Repent and believe the gospel!” Mark 1:15\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→And you will be saved by this gospel, if you do not believe in vain but hold fast to what I preach to you. What I also delivered to you was: First, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15: 2-4\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For the righteousness of God is revealed in this gospel; this righteousness is by faith from faith to faith. As it is written: “The righteous shall live by faith.” Romans 1:16-17\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(3)You must be born again<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a person is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of flesh is flesh; that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. I say, 'You must be born again ' Don't be surprised. John 3:5-7<br \/>\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy he has given us new life into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 1 Peter 1:3\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(4) Anyone who lives and believes in him will never die<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life.

Do you believe this?\" John 11:25- 26<br \/>\n(I wonder if you understand: What does the Lord Jesus mean by these words? If not, then you should be humble and listen more to the true gospel preached by God’s workers.)<br \/>\n4. His commandments are not hard to keep\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe love God by keeping His commandments, and His commandments are not burdensome. 1 John 5:3\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Is the Law of Moses → difficult to keep?<br \/>\nAnswer: Difficult to defend.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why is it difficult to defend?<br \/>\nAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point is guilty of breaking all of them. James 2:10\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→Everyone who keeps the law as his basis is under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is anyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law (Article 613) \"No one is justified before God by the law (that is, by keeping the law), because the Bible says: \"The righteous shall live by faith.\" Galatians 3:10-11.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How to keep the law?<br \/>\nAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(1) Jesus’ love fulfills the law<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it. Truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one jot will pass away from the Law. It will all come true Matthew 5:17-18.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: How did Jesus fulfill the law?<br \/>\nAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→...The LORD has laid upon (Jesus) the sin of us all—Isaiah 53:6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→ For the love of Christ compels us; for we consider that, since one died for all, all died; 2 Corinthians 5:14\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→... through the body of Christ we are also dead to the law... But since we died to the law that binds us, we are now free from the law... See Romans 7:4, 6 and Gal 3:13\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→Owe no man anything except to love one another, for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. For example, the commandments such as \"Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not covet\", and other commandments are all wrapped up in this sentence: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" Love does no harm to others, so love fulfills the law. Romans 13:8-10\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(2) Must be reborn<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1 Born of water and the Spirit--John 3:6-7<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2 Gospel. The true word gives birth to—1 Corinthians 4:15, James 1:18<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3 Born of God--John 1:12-13<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhoever is born of God does not sin, because the word of God abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 1 John 3:9\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(3) Live in Christ<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. Romans 8:1-2<br \/>\nWhoever abides in Him does not sin; whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him. 1 John 3:6\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(4)His commandments are not difficult to keep<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion: Why are the commandments not difficult to keep?<br \/>\nAnswer: Detailed explanation below\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">→→<\/span> Because (the regenerated new man) abides in Christ--Refer to Romans 8:1<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">→→<\/span> (Rebirth of a new man) Hidden in God--Refer to Colossians 3:3<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">→→<\/span> Christ appears.

(The reborn new man) is freed from the law The \"shadow\" of the law - Hebrews 10:1 → Where there is no law, there is no transgression - Romans 4:15. The (new man) abides in the true image of Christ, is hidden with Christ in God, and abides in the love of God. The (new man) only appears when Christ appears. Therefore, the (new man) has not broken a single law and has kept all the laws. He has not violated any law and sinned. Amen!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t→→Whoever is born of God does not sin, because the word of God abides in him; nor can he sin, because he is born of God. 1 John 3:9 (More than 90% of believers fail to pass this test and fall in the mold of faith and doctrine) - refer to Romans 6:17-23\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI don’t know, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">Whoever hears the word of the kingdom of heaven and does not understand it, the evil one comes and takes away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown on the roadside.<\/span> . Matthew 13:19\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo John said → We love God if we keep His commandments (which is love), and His commandments are not grievous. For whoever is born of God overcomes the world; and that which gives us victory over the world is our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Isn’t it the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 1 John 5:3-5\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGospel Transcript:<br \/>\nWorkers of Jesus Christ!

Is it a sin that does not lead to death?<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Answer: Detailed explanation below<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>【1】Sins outside the covenant law between God and man<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJust like in ancient times when there was no marriage law, it was not a sin for a brother to take his sister. For example, Abraham married his sister Sarai. Genesis Chapter 20:12 Moreover, she is indeed my sister; she is my half-brother and later became my wife. There are also records in Genesis 38 about Judah and Tamar, that is, the sin of fornication and incest between the father-in-law and Tamar.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn John 2, there is also a Gentile prostitute named Rahab, who also committed the sin of telling lies, but Gentiles did not have the Law of Moses, so it was not considered a sin. These are sins outside of the legal covenant, so they are not considered sins. Because the law provokes wrath (or translation: causes people to suffer punishment); \"where there is no law,\" there is no transgression. --Refer to Romans 4:15. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>[2] Sins committed by the flesh<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet’s study Romans 8:9 in the Bible and read it together: If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are no longer of the flesh but of the Spirit. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNote: If the Spirit of God, that is, the Holy Spirit \"dwells\" in your hearts, you are not of the flesh → that is to say, you \"hear\" and understand the true way and believe the gospel of Christ → are baptized by the Holy Spirit → that is, the \"new man\" who is reborn and saved is not Belongs to the \"old man\" body. Here are two persons → one is born of the Spirit of God; the other is born of Adam-parents. The visible transgressions of the \"old man\" in the flesh will not be imputed to the \"new man\" who is hidden with Christ in God. As the Lord says: \"Do not hold the trespasses of their \"old man\" against their \"new man\"! Amen - refer to 2 Corinthians 5:19. Do you understand this clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe apostle \"Paul\" rebuked the Corinthian church: \"It is heard that fornication is taking place among you. Such fornication does not exist even among the Gentiles, even if someone takes his stepmother... who has committed the evil act of fornication and adultery will be punished Cast such a person out from among you and give him to Satan to \"corrupt his flesh\" so that his soul may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus - for such a person is. If you live according to the \"old man\" and want to destroy the temple of God, the Lord will punish him and destroy his body so that his soul may be saved. Colossians 3:5 Therefore, put to death your members who are on earth. Fornication, impurity, evil passions, evil desires, and greed (greed is the same as idolatry). Therefore, the process of putting off the \"old man\" body of the \"new man\" → is a process of suffering with Christ. The death of Jesus is initiated in us. Let the life of Jesus be revealed in us → It is God who gives you glory, reward, and crown! It is also the spiritual path that Christians must take. Amen! Do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; all things have become new. …This is how God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting this message of reconciliation to us. --Refer to 2 Corinthians 5:17,19.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRomans 7:14-24 Just as the apostle \"Paul\" was born again and the flesh was at war with the spirit, so I know that there is no good thing in me, that is, in my flesh. Because it’s up to me to decide to do good, but it’s not up to me to do it. Therefore, the good that I want, I do not do; the evil that I do not want, I do. If I do something I don’t want to do, it is not me who does it, but sin that lives in me. The old human flesh was crucified and died with Christ. It is no longer me who lives, but Christ lives for me. As the apostle \"Paul\" said! I consider myself dead to \"sin\" and I am dead to the law because of the \"law\" - refer to Romans 6:6-11 and Gal. 2:19-20. It explains that the \"new man\" after being reborn and saved does not belong to the sins of the \"old man\"'s flesh. The Lord says! Remember no more, and do not impute the sins of the old man's flesh to the \"new man.\" Amen! Then he said, \"I will remember their sins and their transgressions no more.\" Now that these sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer sacrifices for \"sin\" anymore. So, do you understand clearly? --Refer to Hebrews 10:17-18\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Warning: King David also committed adultery and murder in the flesh, and the disaster of the sword came to his family in the flesh. He said in the Psalm that those who are counted righteous by God \"outside of works\" are blessed. Because of God's \"righteousness\" Revealed \"outside the law\" - refer to Romans 3:21. Likewise, \"King Saul and the traitor Judas\" also regretted their actions and confessed their sins because they \"unbelieved\" and did not establish regulations on [faith]. , God did not forgive their sins. Do you understand clearly?

They can be justified and have eternal life by believing in Jesus Christ alone. But the Jews have the Law of Moses. They must first repent of their sins and be baptized in water. They must believe in Jesus and be baptized by the Holy Spirit to be saved and have life. ! )\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOK!

Adam was a type of the man who was to come.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 Corinthians 15:21-22 For since death came by one man, so also did the resurrection of the dead come. As in Adam all die, so in Christ all shall be made alive.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHebrews 9:27 It is appointed for men to die once, and after that the judgment.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(Note: By examining the above scriptures, we record that Adam's \"sin of breaking the covenant\" is a sin that leads to death; Jesus Christ, the son of God, has washed away people's sins with his own \"blood\". Those who [believe] in him will not be condemned → Eternal life; those who do not believe have already been condemned - the \"blood\" of Jesus has washed away people's sins, and you [unbelieve] → will be condemned, and there will be judgment after death → \"According to you, you are under the law \"You will be judged for what you do.\" Do you understand this clearly?)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428090633690.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>【2】Sin based on the practice of law<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGalatians 3 Chapter 10 Everyone is under a curse who does the works of the law, for it is written: “Whoever does not continue to do everything written in the book of the Law is under a curse curse.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> By studying the above scriptures, we record that anyone who takes the practice of the law as his identity, who boasts in being justified by keeping the rules of the law, who pays attention to the ritual regulations of the law as a sign of humility, who keeps the law as his life, and who \"walks in the law\" Those who do not live up to the \"righteousness of the law\" will be cursed by the law; those who do not pay attention to God's mercy and the rewards of grace are cursed. So, do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not as good as a gift to be condemned because of one person's sin. It turns out that judgment is condemned by one person, while gift is justified by many sins. If through one man's transgression death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who have received abundant grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through one man, Jesus Christ? …The law was added from outside, that transgression might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded all the more. Just as sin reigned in death, so grace reigns through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -Refer to Romans 5 verses 16-17, 20-21. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs the apostle \"Paul\" said! But since we died to the law that bound us, we are now free from the law...--See Romans 7:6.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of the law I died to the law, that I might live to God. --Refer to Gal. 2:19.

Amen!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(I)Everyone in the world commits crimes and breaches of contract<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause all have sinned...--Romans 3:23 Therefore all have broken God's covenant, both Gentiles and Jews have broken the covenant and sinned. Romans 6:23 The wages of sin is death. Jesus, the Son of God, died for our sins to atone for the sins committed by man in the \"previous covenant\", which are the \"sins of Adam breaking the covenant\" and the sins committed by the Jews in violating the \"law of Moses\". Jesus Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, freeing us from the law and its curse - see Gal. 3:13.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(II) Those who do not keep the New Covenant but keep the Old Covenant<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHebrews 10:16-18 \"This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord: I will write my laws on their hearts, and I will put them within them.\" ; and then he said, \"I will remember their sins and their transgressions no more.\" Now that these sins have been forgiven, there is no need for any more sacrifices for sins. (But people are always rebellious and stubborn, always trying to find ways to remember the transgressions of their flesh. They don’t believe what the Lord said! The Lord said they will not remember the transgressions of the flesh. The transgressions of the flesh were crucified with Christ. Why do you remember it? Do you believe in your own feelings or in the words of the covenant made with the Lord’s blood? Now that these sins have been forgiven, there is no need to sacrifice for sins anymore. Do you understand?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tKeep the sound words which you have heard from me, with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus. You must \"keep\" the \"good way\" that was entrusted to you by relying on the Holy Spirit who lives in us. The scale of pure words → You have heard the word of truth, which is the good word, the gospel of your salvation! Rely on the Holy Spirit and keep it firmly; I am not telling you to go back to observing the Old Testament Law of Moses. Do you understand? --Refer to 2 Timothy 1:13-14\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(III) Those who return to keep their previous covenant<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGalatians 3:2-3 I only want to ask you this: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by the works of the law? Is it because of hearing the gospel? Since you were initiated by the Holy Spirit, do you still rely on the flesh for perfection? Are you so ignorant?<br \/>\nChrist sets us free. So stand firm and don’t let yourself be held hostage by the yoke of slavery any longer. --Refer to Plus chapter 5, verse 1.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t( <strong>Note:<\/strong> Jesus Christ redeemed us from the old covenant and freed us to establish a new covenant with us. If we go back to abide by the laws of the \"first covenant\", wouldn't this mean that we have abandoned the new covenant that the Son of God made with us through his own blood? Are you so ignorant? It is also a metaphor for us modern people, is it okay to abide by the laws of the ancient Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Tang Dynasty or Han Dynasty? If you keep the ancient laws in this way, don’t you know that you are violating the current laws?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGal 6:7 Don’t be deceived, God will not be mocked. Whatever a man sows, that will he also reap. Don’t be held hostage again by the yoke of sin’s slaves.

He who believes in Him is not condemned; but whoever does not believe is already condemned because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds in the air, and over every living creature that moves on the earth.”—Reference Genesis Chapter 1 verses 26-28\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(2) Adam was created from dust and fell<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible also records this: \"The first man, Adam, became a living being with spirit (spirit: or translated as flesh)\"; the last Adam became a spirit that makes people alive. --Refer to 1 Corinthians 15:45\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to work it and to keep it. The Lord God commanded him, \"You may freely eat from any tree of the garden, but you shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day you eat from it you will surely die!\" - Genesis 2 15 - Section 17.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. The serpent said to the woman, \"Did God really say that you are not allowed to eat from any tree in the garden?\"...The serpent said to the woman, \"You will not surely die, for God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened.

Breaking the law is sin. The law includes: commandments, statutes, regulations, and other provisions of various rules and regulations \"covenant\", this is the law. When you break the law and break the law, it is [sin]. So, do you understand clearly?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(1) Adam’s Law:<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"Thou shalt not eat\" is a commandment! In the Garden of Eden, \"God made a covenant with man. He made a commandment with the ancestor Adam → Jehovah God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and guard it. The Lord God commanded him: \"You may freely eat from any tree of the garden, but you shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day you eat from it you will surely die!\" Refer to Genesis 2 Chapter 15 -17 knots.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe first ancestor [Adam] broke the law and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This was Adam breaking the law and breaking the law! Breaking the law is [sin], so Adam broke the commandment of the law and sinned. This Just as \"sin\" entered the world through one man, Adam, and death came from sin, \"because the wages of sin is death\" then death comes to everyone because everyone has sinned without the law. First of all, sin is already in the world; but without the law, sin is not considered a sin. In other words, if there is no legal commandment of \"you must not eat\", it would not be considered as if the ancestor Adam \"ate of the fruit of the tree\". Sin, because Adam did not break the law. Do you understand clearly? Refer to Romans 5:12-13 and Romans 6:23.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(2) The relationship between law and sin:<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1 Where there is no law, sin is not considered sin--Refer to Romans 5:13<br \/>\n2 Where there is no law, there is no transgression--Refer to Romans 4:15<br \/>\n3 Without the law, sin is dead—see Romans 7:8. This is the relationship between law and sin! So, do you understand clearly?<br \/>\n4 With the law - if you sin under the law, you will be judged according to the law - Romans 2:12\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"\/static\/upload\/image\/2023\/20230428085206390.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(3) The fleshly one gives birth to sin through the law:<\/strong> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause when we were \"in the flesh,\" the evil desires that were born of the \"law\" were the evil passions and desires of the flesh. \"Come; sin, when it has fully grown, brings forth death\", that is, it bears its fruit of death. Refer to Romans 7:5 and James 1:15.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs the apostle Paul said: \"Before I was alive without the law; but when the commandment came, sin came to life again, and I died. The commandment that gave life instead made me dead; because sin Taking advantage of the opportunity, he seduced me through the commandment and killed me. So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good. He who is good is the one who caused me to die. Absolutely not! It is sin that kills me. But sin is shown to be sin through the good one, and sin is shown to be extremely evil because of the commandment. Verses 9-13. So [sin] exists because of \"the law\". This is why \"God\" uses the apostle \"Paul\" who is the most proficient in Jewish law. \"Paul\" leads us to clearly find \"sin\" through the Spirit of God. \"The relationship with \"the law\". Amen!
